Actually, after oil removal and ash removal processing from tire pyrolysis, we can get high-purity commercial carbon black, which can be used to make color masterbatch, color paste, oil ink, and as addictive in plastic and rubber products. Besides, after activation treatment, the carbon black will become good materials to produce activated carbon.

## Compost
Compost is a mixture of ingredients used as plant fertilizer and improve soil physical, chemical and biological properties. It is commonly prepared by decomposing plant, food waste, recycling organic materials and manure. The resulting mixture is rich in plant nutrients and beneficial organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, nematodes and fungi.Compost improves soil fertility in gardens

## How is it Produced? — ICBA
The carbon black produced is conveyed through the reactor, cooled, and collected in bag filters in a continuous process. Residual gas, or tail gas, from a furnace reactor includes a variety of gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Most furnace black plants use a portion of this residual gas to produce heat, steam, or electric power.

## Separation of ash and char in the formation of carbon black from coal 
The process comprises the steps of introducing coal, fuel and air into a down draft slagging combustor operating above the melting point of ash to form a rapidly moving partially combusted stream of molten ash, char, carbon black and flue gas in the combustor. The molten ash aggregates as it moves down the combustor.
