Type Copper Ore Concentrate Processing. Pyrometallurgical techniques use heat to separate copper from copper sulfide ore concentrates. Process steps include mining, concentration, roasting, smelting, converting, and finally fire and electrolytic refining. 12.3.2 Process Description2 4 Mining produces ores with less than 1 percent copper.

## Copper Ore Processing Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Copper Ore Processing Methods. The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.

Concentrates are the raw material for all copper smelters, which by processing it obtain an impure form of metallic copper, anode or blister copper, which is later used to produce high purity refined copper. The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation.
