There are 5 types of controls that can be applied, each intended for a specific purpose: 1. Elimination. This control is considered as the most effective method. It involves physically removing or eliminating the hazard from the environment where it poses risks to people (e.g., hazardous equipment, machines, tools or materials). 2. Substitution.

##  Contractor & Visitor Management
A Hazard is anything that has the potential to cause harm. Hazards can be associated with (but not limited to) a task, process, animal, plant and equipment, site design, location or environmental conditions. The Risk is the potential outcome of being exposed to a hazard. All activities conducted by an organisation have some level of risk attached.

## What is Hazard? Types Of Hazards & Control Measures
Hazards risk assessment is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks posed by hazards. It is a proactive approach to managing health and safety and can be used to identify potential hazards before they occur. The first step in conducting a hazard risk assessment is identifying the hazards in your workplace.
