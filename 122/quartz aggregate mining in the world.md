## Mining | Tennessee Encyclopedia
Tennessee's rank among mining states has fallen rather steadily since the late nineteenth century, although mining and quarrying have remained significant industries. At the turn of the century, Tennessee had 241 mines and quarries, turning out products valued at $9,533,782. This ranked eighteenth among the states.

Crushing: this is the first stage after mining, in which the quartz chunks are sent to the jaw crusher for breaking up the large lumps. It is also done by forklift or manpower. These crushed pieces are then washed and scrubbed. Physical processing: the physical process involves cleaning the surface of the quartz.
