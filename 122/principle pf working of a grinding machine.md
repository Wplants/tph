## principle of working of grinding machine
11/27/2018· Working Principle of Surface Grinding Machine: Surface Grinding Machine uses a rotating abrasive wheel to remove the material from the surface of the workpiece to create a flat surface with a high surface finish. The grinding wheel revolves on a spindle and the workpiece is mounted on a reciprocating table.

## What Is Grinding and Its Working Principle and Type?
Sep 28, 2021What Is the Working Principle of Grinding Machines? During the grinding process, the grinding surface of the grinder tool is evenly coated with abrasive. If the material hardness of the grinding tool is lower than that of the workpiece, when the grinding tool and the workpiece move relative to each other under pressure, the abrasive has sharp edges and corners.

The working principle of a grinding machine is quite easier to understand. In a grinding machine, there is an electric motor which supplies the motion power to the grinding wheel with the help of a belt and pulley. So when we start the electric motor the motor rotates at a certain rpm ( RPM, it may change according to the types of grinding machine) with the help of v-belt and cone pulley the grinding wheel also starts rotating and we perform the operation.
