## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are

Rock Crushers Crushing Equipment Kemper Equipment. Cone crushers. similar to jaw and gyratory crushers, cone crushers work by compression, which means they reduce materials by squeezing them until they break apart. like gyratory crushers, cone crushers are built with a rotating mantle in a concave bowl lined with manganese, but the crushing
