## The Effect of Carbonaceous Reductant Selection on Chromite Pre-reduction
Ferrochrome (FeCr) production is an energy-intensive process. Currently, the pelletized chromite pre-reduction process, also referred to as solid-state reduction of chromite, is most likely the FeCr production process with the lowest specific electricity consumption, i.e., MWh/t FeCr produced. In this study, the effects of carbonaceous reductant selection on chromite pre-reduction and cured

## A detoxification and value-added process for chromium ore processing 
Fe-C-bearing dust is a typical solid waste produced in the process of iron and steel production, which contains much valuable elements such as Fe, C, Pb, Zn, etc (Tang et al., 2015, Long et al., 2021, Deng et al., 2022, Rubio-Cintas et al., 2019).The output of Fe-C-bearing dust is generally 8%~12% of that of the total crude steel (Long et al., 2021), the annual output of Fe-C-bearing dust in

## Industrial Carbothermic Reduction Process For Ferrochrome
Accordingly, prior art electrically powered processes for carbothermic reduction of aluminum from Al 2 O 3 are relatively wasteful of energy. In Cochran U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,653, issued July 27, 1976, one of the inventors of the present invention described a two-stage process for carbothermic production of aluminum by direct reduction of alumina.
