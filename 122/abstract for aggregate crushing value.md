## Aggregate Crushing Value Test Method - Project Management 123
Crushing Value Test Procedure. Select clean and dry aggregate passing through 12.5 mm and retained on 10.0 mm sieve. Weight the empty cylindrical measure. Let the weight be 'a' grams. Fill the aggregate in the cylindrical measure in three layers, tamping each layer 25 times with the rounded end of the tamping rod.

The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

So this aggregate was not strong. 4 CONCLUSION. The ACV value is more than 45% for aggregate used for concrete for non- wearing surface and less than 25% for wearing surface like runways and roadways. The higher the aggregate crushing value, the lower the resistance to crushing under the gradually applied compressive load. 5 REFERENCES

## Aggregate Crushing value test procedure | Civil4M
The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.
