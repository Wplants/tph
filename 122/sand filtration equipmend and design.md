Sand Filters vs. DE Filters. Sand filters have a big advantage over DE filters, though they do operate on similar principles. You do not have to add sand to your filter after a backwash, as it all remains in the tank. When backwashing a DE filter, you actually rinse away the DE, along with the dirt caught in it.

Industrial sand filters are commonly used for removing suspended solids from the water using a single-size filtration media. The filtration process can be decided by adjusting the size of the filter sand. The ideal size of each granule usually varies from 0.35mm to 1.2mm. Industrial sand filters can have graded support media layers or be

Slow sand filters are the least complex type of granular media filter. They are typically housed in reinforced concrete structures, with a basin with a bed of relatively fine sand placed over support gravel (0.3-0.6 m in depth) and underdrain piping up to 0.9-1.5 m in length. The filtration rate is from 0.08 to 0.4 m/h.

## How Does Quartz Sand Filter Work? - Filtration Equipment
Quartz sand filter is generally used as a pretreatment of pure water equipment and mineral water equipment. It is mainly through the filter media to intercept and adsorb sediment, colloid, metal ions and organic matter.  Design filtration speed: 8-12 m / h When the water head loss is about 5 meters, it is necessary to carry out backwashing

## Rapid Sand Filtration | SSWM - Find tools for sustainable sanitation 
Rapid sand filters evolved at the end of the 19th century in the United States and quickly gained popularity. By the 1920s, they were widely used as a major water purification method, since necessary facilities required less land area compared to slow sand filters.Today, a combination of flocculation and coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection (e.g. chlorination, ozonation) is
