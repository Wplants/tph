1. The output is changed by adjusting the gap setting at the discharge point of the crusher. 2. Rule of thumb: Twice the setting is the top size discharging from the crusher. 3. The tighter the setting, the lower the throughput. 4. Material breaks to fill the air pockets or voids in the crushing chamber.

Let's review the basics of stall design, so you, too, can create great spaces for your horses. Let's begin with sizing a stall. The typical United States stall size is 12 by 12 feet square. This is a good size for many horses, but will be too small for some larger horses, such as drafts and warmbloods. Larger horses benefit from 12-by-14
