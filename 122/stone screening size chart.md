## What Is #57 Stone? - Dirt Connections
The number "57" is a number that refers to the size sieve that was used to screen and sort the stone. It means that the stone was put through the #57 sieve which produces gravel stones of about 1" to 1.5" in size. #1 crushed stone refers to the largest sized crushed stone. It is about 2″ to 4″ in size.
