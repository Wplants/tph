##  Mine Rehabilitation and Closure Cost
Mine closure is expensive Large open cut mines can cost hundreds of millions - and some cases - over a billion dollars to close. Currently, the Ranger Uranium Mine and Century Mine (zinc) are the two largest mine closures to date. These two mines will cost in the vicinity of $750m to $1bn to close once complete,

What is open pit mining. On the other hand, open-pit mining also be called surface mining, is the most common mining and ranges from very low-priced minerals to finely disseminated gold deposits. When minerals and deposits are found close to the surface and spread across a large distance, the best way to mine is to use the open cut mining method.

The cost of this preparatory work is obviously a charge against the cost of mining the ore, each ton of which must bear its proportionate share. As the stripping-ore ratio (volume or tons of overburden and capping to tons of ore made available for open-pit mining) increases, obviously the cost of stripping per ton of ore increases.

However, by 2006 the gold price climbed into the $600 an ounce range and miners were losing money. Fast forward to 2012, when the average cash cost was $719/oz - 184% higher than 2006.

Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface.
