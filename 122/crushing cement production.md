## limestone mining, limestone crushing, limestone processing production line
The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture.  Step 2: Limestone crushing. Most of the limestone rocks mined from the mine by blasting have large particle sizes. Therefore, it is necessary

## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.
