## Copper Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity. Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils, heat sinks, and heat exchangers. Large amounts are also used to make alloys such as brass (copper and zinc) and bronze (copper, tin, and zinc).

## The Ancient History of Copper - ThoughtCo
Previously local copper mines in Spain and Asia Minor began to serve Rome, and, as the empire's reach broadened, more mines were integrated into this system. At its peak, Rome was mining copper as far north as Anglesey, in modern-day Wales; as far east as Mysia, in modern Turkey; and as far west as the Rio Tinto in Spain and could produce up to

Copper tools and jewellery were traded as currency in Zambia as far back as the 12th century, so it is difficult to say precisely when locals first started mining copper. Records of small-scale copper production date back to 1908 and 1911, when mining took place at Kansanshi and Bwana Mkubwa mines, respectively.

In order to get the copper in the first place, someone needs to mine solid rock that contains copper, extract the copper minerals, throw away the waste rock, and smelt the copper minerals to produce copper metal. Rocks mined for copper typically contain only very small percentages of copper—about 0.7% in the case of most of the big porphyry

## Copper Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Native copper was probably one of the early metals worked by ancient people. Nuggets of the metal could be found in streams in a few areas, and its properties allowed it to be easily worked without a required processing step. Copper's metallic luster attracted people's attention. Today most copper is produced from sulfide ores.

## Copper mining in the United States
Mining began in the period, and continued until shortly after World War I. Copper is present as chalcopyrite, occurring with magnetite, pyrite, garnet, epidote, diopside, and hornblende, in replacement deposits in greenstone. Gold and silver were recovered as byproducts.

How is Copper Mined? Copper is mined in any places around Canada. Using open pits, copper is extracted from below the ground. Copper is found in compounds with a mixture of other metals in ore where it contains about less than 1% copper. To retrieve the copper, the ore is ground, concentrated and slurried with water and chemical reagents.
