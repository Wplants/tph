Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea.

## Behaviour of Paver Blocks With Partial Replacement of Sand Using Quarry 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregate in the production of Paver Blocks. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials. Granite fines or rock dust is a by-product obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust.

## Models For Predicting The Structural Characteristics Of Sand-Quarry 
It is this need to utilize the excess quarry dust, and to reduce the need for natural river sand that has led to it (quarry dust) being used in full or partial replacement for natural sand in concrete, sandcrete block and in soilcrete block production. The use of quarry dust is further encouraged when it is noted that some engineering
