## What is Powder Metallurgy - A Modern Manufacturing Process
In the powder compacting, a high pressure is applied to compact a metal powder in a die. In this process, as high pressure is applied to the powder, the density of the powder changes. The common pressure of 0.5 MPa to 7 MPa is maintained during this process. For metal powder compaction, the pressure ranges from 150 MPa to 700 MPa.
