## What's the Difference Between SAG Mill and Ball Mill
The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's

The typical mechanical inching drive motor speed is around 1500 to 1800 RPM while the mill inching speed is in the order of 0.1 to 0.15 RPM. Thus, the gear reduction ratio between the inching drive motor and the mill is roughly 12,000 to 1. What this means is that the inching drive motor must turn 12,000 times to be able to turn the mill once.
