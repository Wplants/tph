## India M Sand (Manufactured Sand) Market - GMI Research
In India the construction boom has increased the demand of sand by many folds in the last 2-3 decades which is putting a lot of pressure on the traditional source of sand supplies i.e our rivers and causing harm to aquifers, fisheries and protected areas. This has led to a shortage of sand and making it a scarce commodity in some parts of India and there were times when the construction industry almost come to standstill or moved at a snail pace due to the shortage of sand.

## Sand mining
Sand theft or unauthorised or illegal sand mining leads to a widely unknown global example of natural and non-renewable resource depletion problem comparable in extent to global water scarcity. Beach theft is illegal removal of large quantities of sand from a beach leading to full or partial disappearance of the beach. In India illegal sand mining is the country's largest organized criminal

India's cabinet approved the mining reforms at a cabinet meeting in January 2021 chaired by Modi. The winners, simply, are mining companies. These reforms are largely targeted at streamlining the processes and opening up more sites in India to mine, while also levelling the playing field between private enterprise and state-owned endeavours.

Due to high demand, India has to import sand from countries such as Cambodia and Malaysia. The high demand for sand is also the reason why its mining, especially illegal mining, is flourishing. Even though the Indian government had issued guidelines for sustainable mining in the year 2016, they have not been strictly followed in many places.
