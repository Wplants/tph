Jul 29, 2022China needs Iron Ore for its steel industry, driven by its booming economy and the export of steel products. Since China's domestic iron ore does not meet its consumer demand, China has to import Iron Ore from other Countries, such as Australia. (Ou, 2012). Between 2009 and 2019, China imported roughly 62 per cent of iron ore exports worldwide.
