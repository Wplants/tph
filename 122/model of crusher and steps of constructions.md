## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

New crushers have automatic push-button set-up and can be easily run by a single operator. Faster crushers mean more cars crushed per minute, and the more efficient a crushing operation is, the more money the crusher''s owner can make. Once a car reaches the junkyard, it goes through several steps before finally being shredded to scrap metal.
