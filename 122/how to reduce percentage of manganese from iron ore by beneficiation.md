the purpose of manganese ore calcination process is: first, the high-priced manganese oxide is reduced to low-priced manganese oxide, which facilitates the dissolution of manganese into an ionic state during wet leaching process; second, the weak magnetic iron minerals is reduced into ferromagnetic magnetite or maghemite (Î³-fe203), thereby .

## what percentage beneficiation of iron ore
Iron ore and its beneficiation: Most useful metal in the world, Iron, is extracted from iron ore. It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe).  Siderite - FeCO 3 - 48 percent iron ; Iron ore is the
