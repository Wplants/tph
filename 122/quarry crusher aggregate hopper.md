## Grizzly bars and feeders improve primary crushing efficiency
A vibrating grizzly feeder (VGF) is located at the bottom of the hopper and directly feeds into the jaw crusher. As its name would suggest, the VGF vibrates and this agitation causes the material to separate. This process, known as stratification, moves the small material to the bottom and larger to the top.
