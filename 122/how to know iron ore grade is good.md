7 days agoSteel ore is a type of metal obtained from rocks and minerals. In the furnaces used by this industry, iron ore, scrap metal, and other additives are melted to produce steel. The half finished structures are then created from the molten metal before it is rolled, pulled, cast, and extruded into sheets, rods, bars, tubes, beams, and wire.

## high grade vs low grade iron ore
The iron ore industry classifies the material by the concentration of the metal that is present after iron ore beneficiation has been completed. High-grade iron ore must have a concentration of 65% iron or higher, and medium grade of 62% to 65%. Low-grade iron ore includes all mixtures below 62% iron concentration, which are not considered to

## Low Grade, Medium Grade and High Grade Mineralization
For an investor it is very important to know if a drill result is low-, medium- or high grade: this gives you the first impression of the possible financial outcomes of the deposit.. After analyzing and interpreting various drill reports to distinguish low grade, medium grade and high grade mineralization from each other, I have summarized my findings in the following table:

## Low grade iron ore steals spotlight in export markets
India's low grade iron ore accumulated at mine heads has found new found acceptance in the export markets. The inferior grade ore shunned by domestic steel mills is increasingly finding traction in seaborne trade. The tailwinds are favourable- a profound crisis emanating from shutdown of a string of mines owned by Vale after a major dam burst

## Iron Ore | Maritime Economics SA Grade 11
From 2001 to 2008, a surge in Chinese steel production brought a wave of iron ore imports that demanded extensive use of Capesize ships, and that increased the daily charter rate of many of thee vessels to around $200 000 per day, creating a boom time for shipowners. Once the Chinese economy had slowed down, the demand for iron ore declined, as
