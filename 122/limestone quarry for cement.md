## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
Raw materials are extracted from the quarry, then crushed and ground as necessary to provide a fine material for blending. Most of the material is usually ground finer than 90 microns - the fineness is often expressed in terms of the percentage retained on a 90 micron sieve. Once the the raw materials are ground fine enough, they are blended in

To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.
