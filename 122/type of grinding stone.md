Very fine grain has grain sizes from 240 - 2500, while the coarse grain is 8 - 24. The lower the grit and grain size the less attractive the material finish will be. The higher the grain the finer the finish. The highest grain sizes almost look buffed when finished on the grinding wheel.

## How to Choose Grinder Wheels | Wood
2 quick tips for better grinder wheel performance. Because grinders have different diameter arbors, most wheels come with bushings to ensure a perfect fit. Tighten the arbor nut only to "snug"—overtightening can fracture the wheel. Sharpening and grinding clogs abrasive wheels with metal filings and slows their cutting action.
