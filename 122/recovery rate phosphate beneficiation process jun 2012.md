## Phosphate Rock Beneficiation
Many other developing countries have discoveries and are considering their new deposits, often with difficult beneficiation problems, as potential sources of phosphate. Florida Phosphates. Florida phosphate occurs in a sand-clay matrix overlaid by unconsolidated overburden of sand and sandy clays, ranging from 10 feet to 45 feet in depth.

## Recovery Rate - Definition, Formula, and Key Factors
Recovery rate, commonly used in credit risk management, refers to the amount recovered when a loan defaults. In other words, the recovery rate is the amount, expressed as a percentage, recovered from a loan when the borrower is unable to settle the full outstanding amount. A higher rate is always desirable. Although the rate is typically used

## Phosphate Beneficiation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In the Florida area, Phosphate Beneficiation by flotation unlocked the door to vast tonnages of ore which in the past could not be recovered by conventional washing methods which saved only the coarser pebble phosphate. Many of the areas now being mined contain very little or no pebble phosphate, so the main recovery is from the fine sands.
