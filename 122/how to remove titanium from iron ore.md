## iron Ore - Daily Metal Price
Iron ores, usually rich in iron oxide, are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently: magnetite, hematite, pisolitic ironstone, and titanomagnetite deposits. Pure iron metal is silvery white in colour

Jul 20, 2022When crushing, use a jaw crusher for coarse crushing, and then use a cone crusher for fine crushing. When grinding, use a ball mill or a rod mill . As proper grinding fineness is crucial to the flotation results, the particle size of titanium ore generally needs to be ground to less than 0.074 mm for a better flotation effect.

 Titanium is made by a batch process. In the production of iron, for example, there is a continuous flow through the Blast Furnace. Iron ore and coke and limestone are added to the top, and iron and slag removed from the bottom. This is a very efficient way of making something. With titanium, however, you make it one batch at a time.
