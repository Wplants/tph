## What is the Difference Between Quartz and Quartzite?
The first and most significant distinction is that materials alluded to as "Quartz" are human-made. Built stones made of common quartz in a factory. It is an engineered material created by combining color, resin, and crushed stone. Quartzite is a 100% earth-made natural metamorphic rock.

## What is The Difference Between Quartz and Quartzite?
The difference between quartz and quartzite is simple. Quartz is an engineered, man-made product manufactured in a factory by combining elements of quartz, resin, and pigment. Alternatively, quartzite is a natural stone that forms 100% organically deep within the earth that is extracted in blocks by quarrying. We stock the highest quality

Jan 11, 2022However, quartz and quartzite are similar in price, with quartzite being just slightly more expensive. You can expect to pay around $60 to $150 per square foot for quartz countertops and $70 to $200 per square foot for quartzite countertops. Quartzite must be custom cut into usable slabs with a diamond blade, which is a more expensive process.

## Natural Quartzite and Engineered Quartz: What's the Difference?
Because quartz particles are encased in resin, engineered quartz ends up having low porosity even though it is not compressed as much as natural quartzite (water absorption up to 0.02% in weight, according to Breton). On the other hand, the presence of resin means that engineered quartz is softer than natural quartzite.

We recommend that you have your quartzite countertops professionally sealed as some quartzite can have high absorbance rates. Quartzite being a very hard stone unfortunately does not make it more resistant to stains.

## How to Care for Quartz and Quartzite Surfaces in Your Home
When you have a quartzite countertop, you will need to seal the surface at least once a year. Since quartzite is porous, it requires more maintenance than quartz countertops. Quartz countertops are made with resin, and this resin binds the minerals in the stone together, so the surface is non-porous. Non-porous surfaces don't need to be sealed.
