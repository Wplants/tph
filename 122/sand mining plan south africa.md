## Sand Mining - Coast KZN
Sand mining is largely driven by demand for development of houses and associated infrastructure. Sand mining is a consumptive activity that results in a net decrease in the resource, such that less sand may be available for coastal replenishment and hence other, often non-consumptive, uses such as recreation and tourism.

The regulation of sand mining in South Africa. Sand mining in South Africa is controlled by a complex regulatory system that can be distilled into three main themes: mineral regulation; environmental regulation; and land use planning regulation. In this thesis, it is hypothesised that sand mining is subject to all three regulatory themes equally.

## The regulation of sand mining in South Africa - University of Cape Town
Abstract: Sand, an important input to the construction industry, is extensively mined from the environment leading to depletion of the resource as well as damage to riparian habitat and the alteration of river beds and banks. Sand mining in South Africa is controlled by a complex regulatory system that can be distilled into three main themes: mineral regulation; environmental regulation; and land use planning regulation.
