Measure the length and width of the area in feet. Multiply these figures together to find the area in square feet. Multiply your total area in feet by the depth you want your material in inches. Divide your answer by 324 (1 cubic yard of material will cover 324 square feet 1 inch depth). Texas Garden Materials provides quality landscape supplies.

To find the volume needed, determine the amount of area to be covered by gravel as well as the desired depth of the gravel. The ideal depth of gravel varies depending on the application, but a minimum of 2-4 inches of gravel is a workable baseline. Multiplying the area to be covered by the desired depth yields the volume of gravel you will need.

Feb 25, 2022Multiply the length (L), in feet, by the width (W), in feet, by the height (H), in feet, and divide by 27. This number is how many cubic yards of crushed stone you need. As an example, let's say your DIY project is a patio, and it calls for the use of crushed stone as a base. If your patio is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, and you need 6 inches

How to calculate concrete: Determine how thick you want the concrete. Measure the length and width that you'd like to cover. Multiply the length by the width to determine square footage. Convert the thickness from inches to feet. Multiply the thickness in feet by the square footage to determine cubic feet.
