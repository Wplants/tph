## Waste-to-energy plant
A waste-to-energy plant is a waste management facility that combusts wastes to produce electricity.This type of power plant is sometimes called a trash-to-energy, municipal waste incineration, energy recovery, or resource recovery plant.. Modern waste-to-energy plants are very different from the trash incinerators that were commonly used until a few decades ago.

## Construction and demolition waste recycling - Metso Outotec
Many of the challenges in processing construction and demolition waste are caused by the variable properties of the materials. By nature, the waste generated at demolition sites is bulky and often heavy, which increases transportation costs. Reducing the waste to smaller and uniform grain size makes it easier and faster to handle.
