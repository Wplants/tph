Barium, from barite used as a weighting agent, may reach 400,000 tng/l in muds used for deeper wells (Neff; EPA). Because of contact with petroleum bearing formations (as well as the use of petroleum as an additive), used drilling fluids may contain a number of organic compounds of potential concern.

In the central Missouri region mining of barite is also recorded at an early, though somewhat later, date. In Broadhead's report of 1873 mention is made of a barite grinding plant on Osage river which had been in operation for at least five years previously, and of shipment of ground and raw barite by boat down the river to St. Louis.

Barite (Barytes) in the Paint Industry. Barite is used as a filler in the manufacture of paints. It helps to regulate the thickness and the stability of the paint. Barite also makes the paint brighter. It gives uniformity to the paint's texture which in turn increases the smoothness of the finish. It is also used as a pigment for paints.
