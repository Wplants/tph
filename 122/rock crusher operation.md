In general, a rock crushing plant will have a primary crusher, primary screen, secondary crusher(s) and secondary screen(s), and associated conveyors and stockpiles. It may also involve portable generators powered by diesel engines. Emissions of each pollutant must be less than 100 TPY for the facility to be a minor source.

## Rock Crusher - Eastman Rock Crusher
Stone rock crushers are widely used in many sectors such as mining, smelting, building materials, highways, railways, water conservancy, and chemical industries. At present, there are two types of stone crushing machines commonly used: mobile stone crushers and stationary stone crusher equipment. Stationary crushers include jaw crushers, impact crushers, hammer crushers, roller crushers, cone crushers, etc.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a "V"-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. This is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other. Compression is created by forcing the rock against the stationary plate in the crushing chamber as shown in Fig. 13.9. The opening at the bottom of the jaw plates is adjustable to the desired aperture for product size.

Rock crushers are machines designed to break large rock parts into smaller pieces or get rock dust and gravel. The truth is that rock crushing appliances are vital for most modern commercial mining works. It is because a mining industry can leverage the ability of rock crushers to process rocks with ore before the mineral is derived later.

"In a crusher, the crushing chamber is going around in a circle and the crusher is closing up in one location," Dobler says. "Once you have segregation in that chamber, one side is coarse and the other is fine. Over time your components will feel that, and they will fail." The same logic applies to impact crushers, Dobler adds.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
