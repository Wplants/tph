## A visit to the Carrara marble quarries - L'Italo-Americano
In the Carrara marble basin, there are three areas designated to quarries, they are the known as the Torano, Colonnata and Fantiscritti quarries. I visited the Fantiscritti quarries and they are the most famous of the once existing Roman city of Luni. I booked a tour with Carrara Marble Tour company and our guide Davide was a wealth of knowledge.
