Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has been present ever since the planet formed its surface. All life on earth has developed in the presence of zinc. The concentration of zinc in nature without the additional influence of human activities (anthropogenic emissions) is called "natural background.".

Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining.A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc minerals in ore as its primary product. Common co-products in zinc ores include minerals of lead and silver.Other mines may produce zinc minerals as a by-product of the production of ores containing more valuable minerals or metals, such as

A common limitation across all zinc-mining and zinc-smelting companies who reported data for this study was a lack of data surrounding water treatment and discharge. For many mines, water leaks into the site and must be collected. Some of this water is used for cooling machinery, but generally, much of it is sent to treatment or tailing ponds.

Calamine is actually a secondary mineral, found principally in the oxidized zone of the zinc-bearing ore deposits. It is derived from the alteration of the primary zinc sulphide (ZnS) mineral sphalerite. This is generally a dark grey or black, highly lustrous mineral, but can vary in appearance. Both occur on Mendip.
