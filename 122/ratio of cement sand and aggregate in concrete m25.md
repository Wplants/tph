5.0.1.4 Water-Cement Ratio.The water-cement ratio is a convenient measurement whose value is well correlated with PCC strength and durability. In general, lower water-cement ratios produce stronger, more durable PCC. If natural pozzolans are used in the mix (such as fly ash), then the ratio becomes a water-cementitious material ratio.. Work it to the Perfect Concrete Mix Ratio.

## How Cement, Sand and Aggregate ratios influence Concrete  - Happho
Total Aggregate by cement ratio (A/C) decreases with increase in grade of concrete. For example, M20 grade of aggregate will have a higher A/C ratio than of M30. Higher the Aggregate/Cement ratio leaner the concrete mix, as cement content is lower. Concrete mix can be made more workable by fine tuning Aggregate/Cement ratio.

## Different grade Of Concrete And Their Uses - Concrete Mix Ratio
Like mix proportion of M20 concrete will be 1:1.5:3 and that of M25 concrete will be 1:2:4. It is written as cement:sand:aggregate. This mix proportion of concrete grade is divided into two types:  Its mix ratio is 1:1:2 (Cement: Sand: Aggregate) with crushing strength of 25MPa. Subscribe to latest Updates.

## M25 Concrete Ratio: Concrete Mix Design (1:1:2) - Dream Civil
M25 concrete ratio means a grade of concrete in which M means a mix of concrete and the number 25 denotes for compressive strength of concrete cube attending 25 MPa (N/mm 2) after 28 days of curing. M25 concrete is nominal concrete that can be skillfully prepared with the use of Indian Standard 10, 262:2009.

Apr 15, 2022Volume of cement = Ratio of Cement / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57 = 1 / 5.5 x 1.57 = 0.28 m ^3 Now, 1 cubic meter of cement = 1440 kgs (approx.) Hence, 0.28m^3 of cement = 1440 x 0.28 = 403 kgs So, 1 m^3 of Concrete requires 403 kgs of Cement. Number of Cement Bags required for 1m^3 of Concrete = 403/50 = 8.06 = 8 bags (aaprox.)
