## The Importance of Material Grinding in Manufacturing
Introduction. There are several processes of manufacturing that are important for the conversion of raw materials into finished goods. Most of these processes deal with giving a new shape and form to the raw materials either by changing their state or shape. One such important process is grinding, and it is very useful technique for metal

## Grinding | A Brief Overview of the Machining Process - SourceHorizon
Grinding. Grinding is a machining process used to improve surface finish, cut hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical part surfaces by removing a very small amount of material. While the grinding process has been vastly improved upon with the addition of CNC, it is still a very slow way to remove stock from a part.

## Could Switching to Grinding Help My Manufacturing Process?
One significant benefit to grinding is the compressive residual stresses that are imparted into the surface of the part during a machining process. If residual stresses are causing parts to twist, warp or bend after your machining process, grinding is an excellent way to remove material and relieve some of these stresses in the part.
