## Normal Compressive Crushing Strength Of Sedimentary Limeston
Dec 09, 2013 The crushing strength test for the compressive strength was carried out in accordance with 32, 36 using compressive strength test machine as specified by 35. A proportion mix ratio of 124 and 136 cement, fine and coarse aggregates at water cement ratio of 0.5 and 0.6 were used to cast the concrete cube of 150 x 150 x150mm for 7, 14
