## Gold extraction - QueensMineDesignWiki
Of the numerous major gold mining operations around the world, most utilize a primary crushing circuit which flows into a SAG mill circuit and then a ball mill circuit.  Free-milling gold ores are defined as an ore from which standard cyanidation (which takes about 20-30 hours) can extract more than 90 % of the gold, under the condition that

The cooled dore bars are secured in the refinery safe and the slag is fed manually into the ball mill for reprocessing. The production rate of the EXAMPLE Gold Mines processing plant is expected to be approximately 4000 troy ounces of combined gold and silver (dore) per day. Each refining day will produce 8-1000 troy ounce dore bars.

Geology - Gold Mines Desert Mining History Stamp Mill A stamp mill was a mechanical crusher, noisy, heavy and somewhat awkward to operate. The stamps were heavy metal weights that were lifted and dropped on the ore by a crankshaft. The crushed ore would then be further refined, usually by a mercury or cyanide process.
