All house-made soft serve and scoop/hard flavors we've tried have been hits. The red velvet cheesecake flavor is particularly special; it has so many huge chunks of cheesecake, and my photo doesn't do it.

## What are the Materials of the Jaw Crusher Plates and Which is Better 
What are the jaw materials of the jaw crusher? High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance.However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

Jaw-crusher Construction. Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines and hence must be robustly constructed. The main frame is often made from cast iron or steel, connected with tie-bolts. It is commonly made in sections so that it can be transported underground for installation. Modern jaw crushers may have a main frame of welded mild steel plate.
