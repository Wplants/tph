## FOUNDRY SAND WASTE - WasteCare
FOUNDRY SAND WASTE. Foundries create metal castings for use in the automotive, art, construction, agriculture, and mining industries. In this process, molten metal is poured into a mold, usually made from sand or ceramics. As castings are created, the sand has to be removed and replaced due to abrasion from the high heat and mechanical stress.

However, a linear approach means used 'waste' glass is sent to landfill with a resultant environmental and economic cost. The cost of disposal for 'waste' has been rising for years thanks to landfill directives and landfill tax rises. As glass is made from ash, soda, limestone and sand, it can be recycled an infinite amount of times.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Glass Recycling
Glass Recycling Facts: Key Takeaways. Glass is 100% recyclable. This means it can be recycled again and again without losing its purity and quality. Glass is manufactured using readily available domestic materials, such as soda ash, sand, limestone, and cullet (furnace-ready recycled glass). Glass recycling uses sand in greater volumes than cullet.

## How is glass produced from raw materials? - A Plus Topper
Glass. The raw material for making glass is sand ( silicon dioxide or silica) which is abundant in the Earth's crust. Glass is formed when silicon dioxide is melted and mixed with other substances like lead (II) oxide, boron oxide, sodium carbonate or calcium carbonate. Generally, glass can be made by heating a mixture of silicon dioxide and

## Applications for glass sand - iQRenew
Sand Blasting Media. iQ Renew is developing abrasive blasting media made from 100% recovered glass. It is the preferred abrasive medium for many applications. Amorphous silica is a safer option for abrasive blasting applications. The angular profile makes it ideal for the removal of a wide range of coatings.
