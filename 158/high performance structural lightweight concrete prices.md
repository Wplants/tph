## high performance structural lightweight concrete prices
It was found that the reduction of the structural defects of high-strength lightweight concrete with high content of hollow microspheres is possible by the use of nanomodifier at the phase boundary. It was shown that the greater effect is achieved for nanomodified high-strength lightweight concrete with average density of kg/m 3.

Share. Lightweight concrete is a mixture made with lightweight coarse aggregates. Low-weight aggregates such as shale, clay, shale, slate, volcanic pumice, ash, or perlite are used to reduce the density. Lightweight concrete is a special type of concrete made to be used for special purposes. It is not commonly used as normal-weight concrete.

## Performance of Structural Lightweight Concrete containing Metakaolin 
The aim of the current research is to determine the multiple influences of the amount of metakaolin and high temperature on the compressive strength of structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) applying response surface method (RSM). For this purpose, the lightweight concrete specimens were produced by pumice sand, and metakaolin replacing with cement at different ratios. The unit weight of
