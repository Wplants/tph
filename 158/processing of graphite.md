## Everything About Graphite | SGL Carbon
Manufacturing process of synthetic graphite. The manufacturing processes for synthetic graphite are comparable to those for ceramic materials. The solid raw materials coke and graphite are ground and mixed in mixing units with carbonaceous binders such as pitches to form a homogeneous mass. This is followed by shaping.

## Does graphite break easily? Explained by FAQ Blog
Graphite is soft because it has weak inter molecular forces between its layers. Diamond is hard due to its giant covalent lattice and it has many strong covalent bonds.  this process also result in the release of dust and very fine particles of Carbon into the atmosphere causing air pollution. What is the hardest substance on earth? While
