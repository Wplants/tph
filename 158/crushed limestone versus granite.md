Apr 22, 2022Crushed Stone #1: Approx. 2″-4″ Wide. Crushed stone grade no. 1 is the largest size with diameters ranging from around 2 inches to 4 inches. As this grade contains larger pieces, it's not suitable for shoveling and stones will need to be moved individually. Typical uses for gravel #1 include: Filling larger holes.

Decomposed Granite. Decomposed granite is simply granite that has weathered to a combination of tiny rocks and silt. Because of its fine texture, it is often used on paths or patios. It's usually rust-colored and fades to tan in the sun. At about $40 per cubic yard, decomposed granite is reasonably affordable and holds up for a long time.

## Difference Between Limestone and Marble
Metamorphic rocks are born when existing rock types are transformed physically/chemically due to high temperatures and pressure; hence limestone gives birth to marble when transformed. The name 'marble' is derived from a Greek word meaning "shining stone". Pure white marbles are obtained from very pure forms of limestone or dolomite
