## Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites more difficult than that 
The Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ f G) of Cu 2 S is less than that of H 2 S and CS 2.Therefore, H 2 and C cannot reduce Cu 2 S to Cu.. On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy of formation of Cu 2 O is greater than that of CO. Hence, C can reduce Cu 2 O to Cu.. C (s) +Cu 2 O (s) → 2Cu (s) + CO (g). Hence, the extraction of copper from its pyrite ore is difficult than from its oxide ore

At one end of the spectrum is the predominantly copper ore, which contains levels of gold mineralization. This would be uneconomic to mine for its gold content, but the gold provides a significant opportunity value.

## copper processing - Ores | Britannica
Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to

## In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore?
How is copper extracted from its ore Class 12? Copper from Cu 2 S can be obtained from its ore simply by heating in air. (I) First step is the heating of sulphide ore of copper in the presence of an excess of air. This process is known as roasting. (II) The second step is the self-reduction of copper.

In the purification of copper by electrolytic refining, the strip of impure copper metal is made the anode and a strip of pure copper metal is the cathode. A solution of copper sulphate is used as the electrolyte. When current is passed through the electrolyte, pure copper from the anode dissolves in the electrolyte.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.
