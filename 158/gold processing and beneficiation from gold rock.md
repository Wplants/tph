Gold gravity separation makes use of gravity forces of materials with different density and difference of mineral granules to enrich gold from the ore. Gravity separation is widely used in gold enrichment for both placer gold ore and rock gold ore. Gravity separation can separate gold from the impurities because there is a big density difference between gold and impurities.

## Guide of Mineral Processing Methods: 3 Main Beneficiation
Jun 11, 2021Chemical Mineral Processing. Chemical mineral processing includes flotation method (physical and chemical mineral processing is the actual flotation), calcination method, leaching method (bacterial leaching and reagent leaching), mixed mercury method and cyanidation method. There are three commonly used mineral processing methods: flotation
