## Gypsum Block | SoilSensor
Gypsum Block. Gypsum blocks use two electrodes placed into a small block of gypsum to measure soil water tension. Wires connected to the electrodes are connected to either a portable hand-held reader or a data logger. The amount of water in the soil is determined by the electrical resistance between the two electrodes within the gypsum block.
