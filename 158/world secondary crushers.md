## Crushers - All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
Cone crushers . Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from technological standpoint, but unlike gyratory crushers, cone crushers are popular in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing stages. Sometimes, however, the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed.

Gyratory crusher is a type of secondary rock crusher. There is a narrow opening at the bottom of gyratory crusher. Only if the stone is crushed into desired shape, it can fall through the opening. The gyratory crusher break down stones by pressing between two components--an eccentrically-gyrating spindle and an enclosing concave hopper.
