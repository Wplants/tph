A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.

## Components of Thermal Power Plant & Working Explanation
Thermal Power Plant Explanation. Thermal Power Plants also called Thermal Power Generation Plant or Thermal Power Station. A thermal power Plant / Station is used to convert heat energy to electric power / Energy for household and commercial applications.In the process of electric power generation, steam-operated turbines convert heat in to mechanical power and then finally electric power.
