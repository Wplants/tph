## Crushed Iron Ore - Eco - English Wiki
Oct 6, 2020Crushed Iron Ore is created by crushing Iron Ore in one of three different crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time cost. The two lover crafting stations also have a byproduct of Crushed Sandstone. Crushed Iron Ore needs to be further refined to Iron Concentrate before it can be smelted into an Iron Bar.

In this way, the elevated cost of processing magnetite ore can be balanced out. Ore bearing rock is reduced by blasting into product which, through a sequential crushing process in ball mills, is reduced to powder fine consistency. Magnetic rollers extract the iron concentrate and the waste is transferred to a tailings facility.
