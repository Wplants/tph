## Dolomite - Spazio Marble & Granite
Dolomite, also known as dolostone and dolomitic marble, is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite. It is thought to form by the post-depositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater. The trend for white and gray lends itself to the typical Dolomite colors. The Dolomites are slightly harder

## Calcite, limestone and marble | Earth Sciences Museum
The calcite in the limestone changes and fossils and layering in the original limestone disappear as interlocking grains grow. If the limestone is pure, a white marble is formed. Limestones may include layers of clay or sand which may form the attractive flow banding and colours found in decorative marble. Uses of marble: Building Stone

## Calcite, Aragonite, Dolomite, Marble - Oakrocks
Dolomite is both a mineral and a rock. The mineral is the pure form, and Dolomite rock is composed mostly of Dolomite, but also with impurities such as Calcite, Quartz, and Feldspar. It is named for the French mineralogist, Deodat de Dolomieu. Though harder than Calcite, Dolomite also is a fairly soft stone-about a 3.5 to a 4.

Marble: Most marble consists of 90 percent or more of calcite or dolomite. As noted in the second paragraph under the OTHER NAMES subheading, the term marble has different connotations in geology versus the marketplace -- briefly, geologists consider it to be a metamorphic rock whereas marketers consider it to be any predominantly calcite- or dolomite-rich rock that takes a polish.

However, as building technology improved with the rise of steel frame construction in the 19th century, reduced wall thicknesses became possible and façade materials no longer had the same structural responsibilities.

## Difference Between Calcite and Dolomite
Calcite vs Dolomite . Dolomite and calcite are minerals containing calcium carbonate. Both of these are hard to distinguish from each other except for few properties. Calcite. Calcite is a mineral, which contains calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). This is an abundant mineral on the earth surface. Calcite can form rocks, and they may grow up to large

Hardness: Being composed of calcite, marble has a hardness of three on the Mohs hardness scale. As a result, marble is easy to carve, and that makes it useful for producing sculptures and ornamental objects. The translucence of marble makes it especially attractive for many types of sculptures.

## Metamorphic temperature investigation of coexisting calcite and 
The calcite-dolomite-quartz marble has also showed relatively lower MgCO3 content and hence rather low temperature (~500 °C). The temperature reached during peak metamorphism of the investigated marble occurrence, based on calcitedolomite solvus was 628 °C. Metamorphic temperatures derived from the present study were shown as a linear graph
