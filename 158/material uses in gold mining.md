## Methods of Gold Mining - Geology In
Placer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extracted. Placer deposits are composed of relatively loose material that makes tunneling difficult, and so most means of extracting it involve the use of water or dredging. Gold panning is mostly a manual technique of separating gold from other materials.

Non-mercury (non-cyanide) gold-extraction techniques need to be promoted and implemented, and where mercury is still used safer work practices need to be employed to prevent exposure.

## Gold Mining Methods
Placer mining takes a variety of forms, including panning, "sluice-boxing", hydraulic mining, and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel. Some modern commercial placer operations are quite large and utilize heavy equipment and river diversions.
