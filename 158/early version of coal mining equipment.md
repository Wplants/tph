In a shaft mine the men as well as the coal are hauled up and down in a sort of elevator. A Drift mine is one that starts from the side of a mountain and extends straight back on somewhat of a level.

## coal mining - Choosing a mining method | Britannica
The various methods of mining a coal seam can be classified under two headings, surface mining and underground mining. Surface and underground coal mining are broad activities that incorporate numerous variations in equipment and methods, and the choice of which method to use in extracting a coal seam depends on many technological, economic, and social factors.
