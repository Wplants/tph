## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel
