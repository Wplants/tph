Sep 24, 2021Use water to cool down the limestone and lubricate the stone before starting the sanding process. Limestone is extremely sensitive to acid-based cleaners, so it is important to just use water. Using any other cleaner could damage the limestone. Use sheet-mounted diamond pads and an orbital sander to sand the limestone.
