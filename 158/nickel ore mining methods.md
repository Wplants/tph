Global nickel deposits come in two types of ore, sulphides and laterites. Sulphides are higher grade and extracted using conventional techniques, while laterites are lower grade and must be extracted through more complex, open-pit mining techniques to remove large volumes of water before refining. Historically, most nickel has come from

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

##  Nickel Smelting and Refining - International Finance Corporation
Primary nickel is produced from two very dif-ferent ores, lateritic and sulfidic. Lateritic ores are normally found in tropical climates where weath-ering, with time, extracts and deposits the ore in layers at varying depths below the surface. Lat-eritic ores are excavated using large earth-mov-ing equipment and are screened to remove boulders.

## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low-grade ores and bleed streams
Whether high-grade or low-grade, nickel ores need to be processed after mining, in order to upgrade their nickel content from 1-4% Ni to 10-20%. Concentrating the nickel ores usually takes place close to the mine site, and involves chemical and physical processes to crush the ore and separate the nickel-bearing and gangue minerals.
