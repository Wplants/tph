## The Hidden Environmental Toll of Mining the World's Sand
Sand mining is the world's largest mining endeavor, responsible for 85 percent of all mineral extraction. It is also the least regulated, and quite possibly the most corrupt and environmentally destructive.  Ironically, much of the sand was being used to maintain coastal defenses and raise delta roads above flood levels. The mining could

## Anisotropic properties of the near-surface in South-Western Niger Delta 
The near-surface anisotropic properties within the South-Western Niger Delta were investigated to determine their impacts on geotechnical constructions. Uphole data analyses reveal a weathered layer that is thickest in the NW, E and SE with an average of 4.2 m and thinnest in the North-Central with a value of 3.8 m; a sub-weathered layer that is thickest in the NW and SW with an average of 32.
