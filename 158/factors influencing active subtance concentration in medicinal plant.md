## A Note on Variation of Active Principles in Indian Medicinal Plants and 
The active principles or constituents (phytochemicals) in medicinal plants are chemical compounds known as secondary plant products. Some secondary products discourage herbivores; others inhibit bacterial or fungal pathogens. Active principles in medicinal plants may affect health, but are not-essential nutrients as our diet does

Medicinal plants extraction is based on mass exchanging processes and occurs due to diffusion from the zones with a higher concentration of substance. Biologically active substances are transferred from the internal structure of plant material particles into the extractant, and the transfer is completed when the concentrations are balanced.
