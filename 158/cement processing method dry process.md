Step 1: Mining. The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded

## Dry Process Cement Production
This method is called a semi-dry process, which belongs to the cement dry process production. Advantages: as the dry process is to directly feed raw material powder into the rotary kiln for calcination, and the moisture content of raw materials is about 1% - 2%, it saves the heat consumption needed for the moisture evaporation.

Ø The dry powder called raw meal is then pumped into a blending silo, where an intimate and uniform mixture is obtained, usually by introducing a compressed air. Ø In the Semi-dry process, the blended meal is sieved and fed into a rotating dish called granulator and water weighing about 12 % of the meal is added at the same time.

## How Is Cement Produced in Cement Plants | Cement Making Process
This type of cement was invented in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin. It is named 'portland cement' because its property is similar to the stone quarried on the Ise of Portland, England. The making process of portland cement in the modern industry can be divided into the wet process, dry process, and semi-dry process.

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement 
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.
