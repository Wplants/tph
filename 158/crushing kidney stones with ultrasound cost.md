And the nuts and bolts are impressive. More than 2,700 kidney stone patients were given either ultrasound or a CT scan when they were admitted at 15 different emergency rooms. Researchers thought the CT scans would be more accurate than ultrasound, but the results were a tossup. The ultrasounds did do BETTER in one important category: false

## Crushing of kidney stones with ultrasound and laser
The procedure for crushing stones in the kidneys is carried out with a holmium laser. Due to the action of a thin beam of concentrated light, moisture evaporates from the formation. Point effect allows to avoid damage to soft tissues. In addition, the maximum penetration depth of the laser is 0.5 millimeters.
