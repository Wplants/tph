## Where Is Iron Mined In The United States - Realonomics
Dec 13, 2021US iron ore mining is dominated by the Precambrian banded iron formation deposits around Lake Superior in Minnesota and Michigan such deposits were also formerly mined in Wisconsin. For the past 50 years more than 90 percent of US iron ore production has been mined from the Lake Superior deposits.
