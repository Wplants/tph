## A study of the chemical effect of marble and granite slurry on green 
A distinctive study was undertaken by Abhishek and Pradeep to examine the effect of partial replacement of sand with granite quarry dust and cement with marble powder in concrete. The results indicated that the compressive strength increased gradually by adding up to 10% replacement of cement with marble powder and 20% replacement of fine

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

## Experimental study of concrete made with granite and iron powders as 
In this present work, granite powder is used as partial replacement of sand in concrete in different percentage and the associated compressive strength, flexural, and splitting tensile strengths of concrete have been evaluated. By doing so, natural resources of sand can be preserved and the health hazards of these industrial wastes are minimized.

##  Experimental Study of Concrete by Partial Replacement of Cement  - Ijets
In this study, the possibility of using granite dust powder in concrete production was examined by studying the effects of blending of granite dust powder with cement on the performance of fresh and hardened concrete. In this experimental study, granite dust powder was used in concrete as a cementetious material as partial replacement of cement.
