## Which of the following process is used in extractive metallurgy of 
Correct option is A) The process involves reducing molten magnesium oxide slag by ferrosilicon under low gas pressure at a very high temperature. The metallic magnesium formed in the process, evaporates and then condensed away from the hot region. hence, we can say, fused salt electrolysis is used in extractive metallurgy of magnesium.
