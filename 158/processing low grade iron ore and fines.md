## Analysis of life-cycle GHG emissions for iron ore mining and processing 
Low-grade ore (< 60% Fe content) undergoes multiple processing steps to increase the overall iron content.  After ore processing, fines require agglomeration, by sintering or pelleting, to form aggregates for use in the blast furnace. Pelletizing plants are usually located at or near the iron ore mines and assumed so located for this study

Totally impressed by the Iron Ore Heritage Trail . The route passes through so many historic and interesting locations in Marquette and surrounding areas. Particularly impressive were the small touches they added, such as the iron rail mile markers along the route and art. Found the kiosks and displays very informative.

In mining and minerals industries, whenever water supplies are restricted and also where wet processing leads to problems in handling and dewatering of the products and tailings, dry beneficiation is preferred. Moreover, the decrease in available high-grade iron ores has generated a need to develop alternative beneficiation processes for processing low-grade iron ores.

## Dry Benefication Of Low-Grade Iron Ore Fines Using a Tribo-Electric 
The STET tribo-electrostatic technology has been used to process and commercially separate a wide range of industrial minerals and other dry granular powders. Here, bench-scale results are presented on the beneficiation of low-grade Fe ore fines using STET belt separation process. Bench-scale testing demonstrated the capability of the STET

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
It has a much smaller particle size than ore fines and cannot be agglomerated by sintering. Instead, concentrates must be agglomerated by pelletizing, a process that originated in Sweden and Germany about but was adapted in the 1940s to deal with low-grade taconite ores found in the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, U.S. Pelletizing
