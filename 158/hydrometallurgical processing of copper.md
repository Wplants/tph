## Hydrometallurgical process for the treatment of copper-bearing ore 
A hydrometallurgical process for recovering copper from copper bearing ores or fractions, by a process of first wetting and sulfatizing the ore with controlled amounts of H 2 SO 4 and water, followed by acid curing and repulping to sulfatize a substantial portion of the copper in the ore. Also, the fine and coarse fractions can be classified, followed by pile leaching the coarse fraction

The aim of this process is to reduce the mass that has to be leached in the hydrometallurgical process. 5. The Inco process, shown in Fig. 1, starts with a combined drying and reduction step, which takes place at 1000 °C in a rotary kiln.

Abstract. The hydrometallurgical processing of industrial converter mattes with the copper-to-nickel concentration ratios (Ni : Cu) of 2 : 1 and 3 : 4 is studied in order to demonstrate the advantages of hydrometallurgical processing methods, which can improve the environment and increase the number of important components extracted from raw materials.

##  Hydrometallurgical considerations in processing arsenic-rich copper 
In any successful hydrometallurgical process treating copper-arsenic concentrates, key results would include high copper extraction during leaching and arsenic deportment to a stable residue. As most of these concentrates also contain significant levels of gold and silver, recovery of these precious metals cannot be overlooked.

The hydrometallurgical process included pressure leaching under slightly oxidising conditions in diluted sulphuric acid (at 80-105 °C and kPa oxygen pressure). This enabled selective extraction of up to 97% of copper, with less than 10% of pyrite taking part in the reaction.

## Hydrometallurgy
Hydrometallurgy is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy, the obtaining of metals from their ores.Hydrometallurgy involve the use of aqueous solutions for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. Processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy, vapour metallurgy, and molten salt electrometallurgy.

This process consumes 2,500 to 3,000 kWh · t -1 of copper produced. The copper is deposited on the cathode and the gases produced at the anode (O 2, Cℓ 2) are recovered selectively and returned to the process. This method produces an extremely pure copper that can then be rolled (hot or cold), drawn or even formed into tubes before being sold.

## How can copper be extracted from hydrometallurgical process?
Copper is purified by electrolysis. Electricity is passed through solutions containing copper compounds, such as copper(II) sulfate. The anode (positive electrode ) is made from impure copper and the cathode (negative electrode) is made from pure copper. Which metal is extracted using a hydrometallurgical process?
