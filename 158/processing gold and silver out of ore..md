## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

Finding the metal was only part of the process. After the discovery was made the next step was to bring the ore out of the ground. In the dry Mojave, hard rock miners dug and blasted, sinking shafts and tunnelings into the mountainside. Next, the ore would have to be crushed into a workable size before the metal could be extracted.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

Gold Refining. Gold mines process ore using various techniques to produce an alloy composed primarily of gold and silver, which is called a dore bar. The composition of dore can vary significantly between mines, but generally the gold dore bars the Perth Mint processes are composed of between 70-80% gold and 10-15% silver.

## 5 Methods of Gold-Silver Ore Extraction | Mining Pedia
Oct 16, 2020When formulating a cyanidation system for silver-containing ore, the following measures should be taken: 1) Leach with concentrated cyanide solution (0.2~0.6% NaCN); 2) Long time (up to 2 to 3 days) leaching; 3) Inflate strongly into the pulp; 4) Add lead salt to the pulp; 5) Bromine cyanidation and so on.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
