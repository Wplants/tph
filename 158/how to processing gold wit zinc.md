In all gold plating, the part is polished and cleaned as thoroughly as possible before the electroplating process starts. Gold plating will look uneven and smudged if the surface is dirty, oily, scratched or otherwise damaged. Modern electroplating begins with the creation of a metal salt using the plating metal, typically gold or silver.
