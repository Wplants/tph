## Magnetite
Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.

## Processing Of Magnetite Iron Ores,Minerals Beneficiation Plant - XSM
Both technologies are already implemented in some magnetite processing operations, although in limited capacity. magnetite ore processing flowsheet. Flow sheet design and option selection should be tailored to the magnetite ore comminution and liberation characteristics. For fine-grained ores the addition of a third grinding stage which
