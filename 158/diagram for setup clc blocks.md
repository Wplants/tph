## Foaming agent for CLC blocks
The vegetable cement foaming agent for CLC blocks is a pale yellow pure transparent oily liquid, which is not sensitive to water, non-toxic and tasteless, and has no sediment. The vegetable foaming agent for concrete is neutral, it is not easy to cause corrosion to cement and metal, and it does not cause environmental pollution.

## Block Diagram - Learn about Block Diagrams, See Examples - SmartDraw
Block diagrams use very basic geometric shapes: boxes and circles. The principal parts and functions are represented by blocks connected by straight and segmented lines illustrating relationships. When block diagrams are used in electrical engineering, the arrows connecting components represent the direction of signal flow through the system.

CLC is called as Cellular Light Weight Concrete and it is also called as Foam Concrete. Cellular Light Weight Concrete (CLC) is a version of light weight concrete that is produced like normal concrete under ambient conditions. CLC Blocks are a cement-bonded material made by blending slurry of cement. Stable, pre-formed foam manufactured on site is injected into this slurry to form foam

Light in Weight: The density of CLC blocks vary from 600 to 800 Kg/cum. This is almost three times less than the traditional clay bricks or flyash brciks. Reduced Construction Cost: The overall dead load of structure is decreased when CLC blocks are used in construction. By optimizing the design accordingly house owners can save money on major construction materials like cement and steel.
