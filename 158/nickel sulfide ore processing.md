In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores undergo flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. After producing the nickel matte, further processing is done via the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of only cobalt and nickel.

1. Differential flotation or partial differential flotation process. When the content of copper is much more than nickel in the ore, this process can be used to separate the copper as the single concentrate. The advantage of this process is that the copper concentrate with lower nickel content can be obtained directly. 2. Bulk flotation process.

For sulfide ore processing, nickel has to be separated from the iron present in the sulfide concentrate. This is conventionally done in both the smelting and converting stages. To aid iron rejection in the smelting stage, the concentrate is first partially roasted to oxidize the iron sulfide. This is done either in a multiple hearth roaster or

Ores Sulfides. Canadian ores are sulfides containing nickel, copper, and iron. The most important nickel mineral is pentlandite, (Ni, Fe) 9 S 8, followed by pyrrhotite, usually ranging from FeS to Fe 7 S 8, in which some of the iron may be replaced by nickel. Chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, is the dominant copper mineral in these ores, with small amounts of another copper mineral, cubanite, CuFe 2 S 3.

Sulfide ores are extracted using underground mining techniques. The ore is crushed and selective floating is used to get some of the nickel from the ore and remove the waste. Magnetic separators are sometimes used as well. Both extraction and refinement of the two ores result in nickel matte, a substance which is a nickel-iron sulfide.

Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low-grade ores and bleed streams
At present, sulfide nickel deposits are the primary source of mined nickel. Sulfide ore grades range from 0.15-8% Ni, with 93% of known deposits ranging from 0.2-2% Ni.  Recovery of Nickel and Processing of Magmatic Sulfide Ores. The processing of magmatic sulfide ores differs from laterites: sulfide ores are crushed in multiple steps to

## The beneficiation process of nickel ore - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining 
Sep 24, 2020The beneficiation process of nickel ore. ; 1,607 Views; icon 1; Nickel ore is mainly divided into copper-nickel sulfide ore and nickel oxide ore, and their beneficiation and processing methods are completely different.. The main method for beneficiation of copper-nickel sulfide ore is flotation, while magnetic separation and gravity separation are usually auxiliary beneficiation methods.

##  Unlocking Disseminated Nickel Sulphides using the CESL Nickel Process
4 CESL Nickel Process The CESL Nickel Process offers a method of unlocking the nickel from disseminated nickel sulphide ore bodies. It is capable of treating lower grade nickel concentrates and those with a high content of magnesia. The process can also treat bulk nickel-copper-cobalt concentrates with no need for metal
