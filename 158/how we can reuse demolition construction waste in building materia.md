## How to Reuse and Recycle Construction Materials
Large pieces can be re-milled and put back to use in construction. Asphalt paving - is crushed and recycled back into new asphalt for paved roads. Trees and brush - are recycled as compost or mulch. Timber, large dimension lumber (i.e. lumber longer than 6 ft), plywood, flooring, and molding - can be reused directly.

6. Asphalt shingles. Sources of recycled asphalt shingles include both shingle manufacturer's scrap and material from roofing jobs. Asphalt shingles can be easily reused in the manufacturing of new asphalt pavement. It is becoming progressively common for shingles to be recycled against being sent to a landfill.

## The importance of materials recovery coordination in construction 
One of the biggest barriers to building material reuse is the unknown (i.e., not knowing exactly what materials may be available, what its structural properties are, and its current condition). Ascertaining this information requires time and money, ultimately disincentivizing material reuse and conservation.

## Construction and demolition waste recycling - Metso Outotec
Many of the challenges in processing construction and demolition waste are caused by the variable properties of the materials. By nature, the waste generated at demolition sites is bulky and often heavy, which increases transportation costs. Reducing the waste to smaller and uniform grain size makes it easier and faster to handle.
