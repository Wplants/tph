## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Currently, the deepest underground mine in the world is the Mponeng gold mine situated in South Africa. In 2019, the Mponeng produced 244,000 ounces of gold! As of 2020, the operating depth ranged from 3.16km to 3.84km below the surface.

## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.
