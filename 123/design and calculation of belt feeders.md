Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

The belt feeder design cannot be done unless the pressure values at interface are known. Therefore, substantial portion of this book is devoted to pressure values from hopper. The book provides interesting and useful information about the pressure calculation from hopper, however, the presented information is in context of belt feeder.

In the case of apron feeders, nothing could be further from the truth. Optimal speed comes from finding that balance where efficiency meets transportation speed. They do operate at slower speeds than belt feeders, but for a good reason. Normally, the optimal speed an apron feeder is 0.05 - 0.40 m/second (10-80 fpm).

If the equipment that passes the material onto the vibratory feeder doesn't restrict the feeder's width, we then look at the volume and density of the material. To calculate the cross-sectional area for material flow based on the rate per hour and bulk density, we'll need an estimated linear velocity for the material.

Belt feeders are short belt conveyors that are specifically designed for material flow regulation, extracting material from one area and ensuring that downstream equipment receives the appropriate volume.  Belt feeder design thus needs to consider all specific requirements determined by the material being moved, as well as capacity and geometry.

## Conveyor Belt Equations
ε = belt elongation, elastic and permanent (%) As a rough guideline, use 1,5 % elongation for textile belts. and 0,2 % for steel cord belts. Note: For long-distance conveyors, dynamic start-up calculations. may be required, because not all elements are set in motion simultaneously, due to the elastic properties of the conveyor belt.

##  Belt Feeder Head Load Investigation.edu.au
The Bruff and TUNRA methods currently used for belt feeder design were reviewed and used to predict the pressure of the belt feeder hydraulic drive  part of this the original design calculations for the belt feeders at site were reviewed with regards to the methods used and assumptions made. The second objective of the project was
