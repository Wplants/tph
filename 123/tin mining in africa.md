## AfriTin: Africa's Namibia-based emerging tin champion
With a three-year timeline to build a 5 000 tpa tin business, the vision beyond this is to double production to 10 000 tpa which could either be the result of further expansion at Uis or through sector consolidation. "This is the vision we need to realise in order to fulfil our goal of becoming Africa's tin champion," Viljoen concludes.

## Tin in South Africa - Sabinet African Journals
This paper gives a brief history of tin mining in South Africa, which dates back almost 3000 years. Over the intervening years, many tin-mining operations have flourished and as quickly disappeared. At present there are only three tin mines in operation, and a description is given of the methods of mining, concentrating, and smelting that are used.

 African tin mining is concentrated in the DRC, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Nigeria. While some industrial mines exist, such as Rutungo Mines in Rwanda, artisanal and small scale mining is the dominant form of mining in Sub-Saharan Africa.

As surface tin resources faded, tinners dug deeper following the lodes—the near-vertical sheets in the rock in which tin ore and other metals are found in Cornwall. The challenges of hard-rock mining and draining water from shafts spurred skills, innovations, and machinery that would be exported around the world.
