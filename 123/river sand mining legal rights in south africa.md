Irresponsible sand mining is also a huge threat to the river banks, bridges, and nearby structures. It also affects the contiguous groundwater system and the usages that local residents make of the river. Sand mining can be responsible for the destruction of riparian and aquatic habitat through huge changes in the channel morphology.

Resistance to mining started when local people became aware of the huge scale of the proposed mine and the impacts mineral sand mining would have on the affected environment and communities. When negative impacts became evident through problems and conflicts at the Hillendale mine, it triggered a response from affected community members.
