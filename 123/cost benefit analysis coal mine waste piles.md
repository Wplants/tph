## Federal Register :: Abandoned Coal Refuse Sites
Since 1977, the AML program has successfully reclaimed about 25,307 acres of abandoned refuse at an expense of over $320 million. As of September 30, 2005, reclamation of an additional 2,515 acres at sites with abandoned coal refuse has been funded with $26.5 million, but not completed.

## How Coal Affects Water Quality: State of the Science
Ahrens and Morrisey were able to identify several studies that examined the effects of coal dust pollution on fish and shellfish. Unfortunately, most of the studies are old, poorly designed, or inconclusive. For example, a 1963 study found that coal washery solids in relatively low concentrations reduced the growth rate of exposed trout.

What is waste coal? Waste coals are the low-energy-value discards of the coal mining industry. Waste coal is called "culm" in the eastern Pennsylvania anthracite coal region and "gob" or "boney" in the bitiminous coal mining regions (western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and elsewhere). Waste coal piles accumulated mostly between 1900 and 1970.

## Types of Mine Waste and Disposal Methods - EDDY Pump
Rock or Solid Mine Waste. Open pit mining has several stages of waste. First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore.

Cockroaches and coal ash EPA hearings begin Coal Tattoo. Aug 31, 2010I am telling you the cockroach story because it is at the root of the reasons why the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) mangled this rulemaking, constructing a fanciful but deadly cost-benefit analysis that predicts negative net benefits of as much as $239 billion if EPA regulates coal ash appropriately

## Cost-Benefit Analysis of HELE and Subcritical Coal-Fired Electricity 
A large potential exists in the Southeast Asia region for deployment of high-efficiency, low-emission (HELE) electricity generation technologies. A cost-benefit analysis of HELE technologies compared to the less efficient subcritical electricity generation plants is thus carried out to find a persuasive scenario supporting quicker transition from subcritical stations towards HELE

The method sets out criteria for projects that reduce emissions either through flaring, oxidation, destruction, or conversion of waste gas to operate an electricity production device. These projects have a significant abatement effect as coal mine waste gas is primarily methane.
