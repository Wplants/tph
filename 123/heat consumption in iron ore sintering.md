## Application of steam injection in iron ore sintering: fuel combustion 
Jun 1, 2022Iron ore sintering is a crucial stage in the whole steelmaking flow, the function of which is to process iron ores (< 8 mm) into lumpy sinter, thereby providing raw materials for ironmaking [1,2,3,4,5]. The sintering heat originates from fuel combustion, either complete combustion or incomplete combustion.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.
