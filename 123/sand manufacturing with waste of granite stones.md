## 7 Types Of Waste In Lean Manufacturing & How To Reduce Them
Waste of Inventory. One of the main principles of Lean Manufacturing is developing a Pull System instead of a Push System. Push Systems are popular and consist of having a large stockpile of inventory on hand. Pull Systems, on the other hand, focus on having minimal inventory and then ramping up production as necessary to meet demand.

## The processing of granite: Step by step - CKP
Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters
