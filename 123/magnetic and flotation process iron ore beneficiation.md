## Iron Ore Beneficiation Flotation Process
Flotation process is also commonly seen in nowadays iron ore beneficiation. It has become a very important way to recover weak magnetic ore. It is also used to treat iron ore fine to reduce the content of silica and impurities. Flotation beneficiation separates ore by different physical and chemical properties of different materials.

## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable
