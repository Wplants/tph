## Semiconductor Manufacturing Overview - AnySilicon
We can split the semiconductor manufacturing process in four main steps: wafer processing, die preparation, IC packaging and IC testing. Only the first process concerns us here, as the other three steps change depending on the circuits that are being made later on. Figure 5 - Wafer processing steps example for CMOS.

## Six crucial steps in semiconductor manufacturing - Stories | ASML
Oct 6, 2021Lithography. Lithography is a crucial step in the chipmaking process, because it determines just how small the transistors on a chip can be. During this stage, the chip wafer is inserted into a lithography machine (that's us!) where it's exposed to deep ultraviolet (DUV) or extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. This light has a wavelength anywhere from 365 nm for less complex chip designs to 13.5

Since then, wafers have been growing in size, as larger wafers result in more chips and higher productivity. The largest wafer diameter used in semiconductor fabrication today is 12 inches, or 300mm. Smoothing things out - the lapping and polishing process . Sliced wafers need to be prepped before they are production-ready.
