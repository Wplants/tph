## Rare Earth Elements (Metals) - List - ThoughtCo
The rare earth elements (REEs) or rare earth metals (REMs) are a group of metals found within the same ores and possessing similar chemical properties. Scientists and engineers disagree on exactly which element should be included in a list of the rare earths, but they generally include the fifteen lanthanide elements, plus scandium and yttrium.

Significant rare earth minerals found in India include ilmenite, sillimanite, garnet, zircon, monazite and rutile which are collectively called Beach Sand Minerals (BSM). India has almost 35 per cent of the world's total BSM deposits. If India taps into its BSM deposits, it can grab a healthy share in the global rare earth supply chains.

The existing recycling infrastructure for fluorescent bulbs makes them good candidates for rare earth recycling, many experts say. With price pressures off, at least for now, and few laws requiring recycling, there is little incentive to try to get the materials back. As of 2011, less than 1 percent of rare earths were recycled.

Until 1948, most of the world's rare earths came from sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the 1950s, South Africa mined most of the world's rare earths. This happened after large veins of a rare earth bearing mineral were found there. Through the 1960s until the 1980s, a mine in California was the leading producer. Today, the Indian and South African deposits still make some rare earth

The rare earths, or rare earth elements (REE), are a relatively abundant group of elements consisting of scandium, yttrium, and the 15 elements of the lanthanide series of the periodic table. Scandium (Sc) is the lightest rare earth element. Scandium is present in crustal rocks in amounts greater than lead and precious metals, but it rarely occurs in concentrated quantities because it does not combine into common ores or minerals.

## Mineral & Rare Earth Elements Analyzer - Thermo Fisher Scientific
Portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology can be used in a wide range of mineralogical and geological exploration markets, one of which is the mining of Rare Earth Elements (REEs). REEs are defined as the 15 lanthanides plus scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y), and they are critical components in consumer electronics, automobile catalytic converters, and rechargeable batteries due to their unique optical and magnetic properties.

## Australia has a key role to play in reducing China's rare-earths 
An iPhone, for example, contains eight different rare-earth minerals, and there are probably a couple in your refrigerator and washing machine. They also make up about 420 kilograms of an F-35 fighter jet and are essential for guided cruise missiles. Despite their name, rare earths are not all that rare.

## DARPA seeks AI coders to help find rare earth minerals
Aug 17, 2022DARPA - the US government's boffinry nerve center - is offering up to $10,000 to programmers who can whip up some AI to help find rare earth minerals on our home world and ease US supply constraints of critical materials needed by the energy and defense industry. To win the money, developers need to compete in a contest that's split into two separate tasks: the Map Georeferencing Challenge, in which maps of unknown regions and coordinate systems need to be pinpointed on a base map by a
