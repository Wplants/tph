## Slag
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

## Manufacture of Steel - Steel Manufacturing Process and Steps
The first step in the steel manufacture begins at the blast furnace. To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal), limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.

A shortage of high-quality iron ore in the marketplace presents a significant hurdle for steelmakers who are trying to reduce their carbon emissions. Green hydrogen-based technologies use less carbon to produce steel, but the process requires higher iron ore grades than traditional blast furnaces. A dearth of ore with an iron content above 65%

How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.
