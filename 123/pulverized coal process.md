## Why pulverized coal is used in power plant?s
Pulverized coal firing ensures complete combustion of coal, thus ensuring higher efficiency of steam generators. It is predominantly adopted in large coal-fired utility boilers.  (the footprints where made during the peat stage but were preserved during the coalification process). Why coal is the best energy source? Cheapest source of energy

## Pulverized Coal Fired Steam Boilers
Pulverized Coal Fired Steam Boilers is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverized fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.

## Novel coal-to-methanol process with near-zero carbon emission 
The coal-to-methanol (CTM) is an important technical route for methanol production. The process suffers from high CO₂ emission and low energy efficiency due to the mismatch of H/C (hydrogen-to-carbon) ratio between raw coal and products. Hydrogen production from renewable energy can be introduced into the system to meet the H/C ratio.

IGCC technology is more expensive than pulverized coal technology, but offers certain environmental advantages. While modern pollution controls for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter can dramatically reduce emissions from pulverized coal plants (by 90 to 99 percent), IGCC plants are capable of even greater reductions.

Impurities can be effectively removed in the grinding process, and the burnout rate is higher.

## Top Gas Recycling Blast Furnace Process - IspatGuru
Cold O2, coal and cold recycled top gas were injected into the tuyeres of the hearth. NKK tested the process in an experimental BF with 3 tuyeres, an inner volume of 3.9 cum and a hearth diameter of 0.95 m. The coal injection rate could be increased to 320 kg/tHM, while the coke rate could be reduced to 350 kg/tHM.
