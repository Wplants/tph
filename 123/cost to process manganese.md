manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

Ferromanganese is a ferroalloy with high manganese content (high-carbon ferromanganese can contain as much as 80% Mn by weight). It is made by heating a mixture of the oxides MnO 2 and Fe 2 O 3, with carbon (usually as coal and coke) in either a blast furnace or an electric arc furnace-type system, called a submerged arc furnace.The oxides undergo carbothermal reduction in the furnaces

## Manganese
The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide (MnO 2) to form iron hydroxide (FeO(OH)) and elemental manganese (Mn): This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.  Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.
