Coarse crushing includes crushing operations discharging at sizes 4- to 6-in. or coarser; intermediate crushing comprises operations taking feeds 6- or 8-in. maximum and making products down to -1/2″ or 3/8″. Fine crushing is reduction by crushing to 1/4″ or finer; the distinctions are not sharp.

## Coal preparation plant
The coal delivered from the mine that reports to the coal preparation plant is called run-of-mine, or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground

Scalping is recommended for a jaw crusher for three main reasons: Capacity increases when material below the crusher setting bypasses the crusher; also the energy consumption is lower.

The crushing system at the Martha Mine open pit consists of a combination of two types of crushers, a jaw crusher and two Stamler feeder breakers. The jaw crusher is capable of crushing material with a strength of over 150 megapascals (MPa). By way of comparison, concrete has a strength of 20-30 MPa. The Stamlers deal with the softer material.

## The Process of Mining Bauxite - Dajcor
Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting, drilling, and bulldozers. The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage.

## Iron ore crushing and screening process
2. Iron ore screening process: Iron ore screening equipment generally uses a circular vibrating screen to screen the materials after the second crushing. Generally, materials with a size of 10mm or less can be screened for dry selection. After screening, materials with a size of 10-40mm enter the fine crusher for fine crushing.
