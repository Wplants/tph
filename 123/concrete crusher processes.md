Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.

There are only two steps! Step one: Remove and break up concrete on your job site into workable pieces. You can do this by attaching a hydraulic breaker to your excavator. For bigger jobs, a pulverizer can be used. Step two: You will want to crush larger pieces of concrete into more manageable pieces using a compact and mobile jaw crusher.

The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.
