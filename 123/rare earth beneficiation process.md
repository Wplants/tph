A review of the beneficiation of rare earth element. 1. Introduction. The term rare earth elements (REEs) refers to the fifteen metallic elements of the lanthanide series, coupled with the chemically similar ytrrium, and occasionally scandium (Gupta and Krishnamurthy, 1992).These elements are typically split into two sub-groups, the cerium sub-group of "Light" rare earth elements

In this project, we want to address beneficiation as one of the aspects of the chemical process of obtaining rare earth form the naturally occurring ores. Beneficiation is the second step of mining after the ore is removed from the ground. Beneficiation process is divided into two steps i.e. physical beneficiation and chemical beneficiation.

In the beneficiation of rare earth minerals, gravity concentration plays a vital role. Many processing flowsheets incorporate gravity concentrators for the pre-concentration of heavy rare earth minerals.  Chan, T. N. (1992). A new beneficiation process for the treatment of supergene monazite ore. In Rare earths: Extraction, preparation and
