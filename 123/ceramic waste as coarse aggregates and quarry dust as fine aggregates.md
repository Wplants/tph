## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

## Ceramic Waste As Coarse Aggregate And Quarry Dust As Fine Aggregate
Concrete With Ceramic Waste And Quarry Dust Aggregates. The coarse aggregate for ceramic waste materials like flowerpot are crushed to small pieces by a hammer. These small pieces are then fed into the vibrator sieved to get the required 14-20mm size. The fine aggregate for quarry dust we just sieved to get the size around 2.36 mm to 150 m.
