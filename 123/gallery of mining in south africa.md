## Gold Mining in South Africa | Africa Mining IQ - ProjectsIQ
In 1975, South Africa was responsible for producing 40% of the gold ever mined. By 2010, however, China affirmed its status as the world's largest gold producer with production of 324 tonnes of gold, followed by Australia (222.8 tonnes), and South Africa with 219.8 tonnes. Today, South Africa produces only 4.2% of the world's gold.

## Reducing water use and pollution in South African mining
Mines in South Africa are employing increasingly sophisticated methods to address the twin issues of reducing water use and stopping pollution. Miners operating in South Africa, where scattered and erratic rainfall is increasingly the norm, describe water as the single-biggest environmental risk to their operations. This is unlikely to change.

In many ways, South Africa's political, social and economic landscape has been dominated by mining, given that, for so many years, the sector has been the mainstay of the South African economy. Although gold, diamonds, platinum and coal are the most well-known among the minerals and metals mined, South Africa also hosts chrome, vanadium, titanium and a number of other lesser minerals.

South Africa in particular has a massive mining industry - it is a major source of diamonds, gold, platinum and coal, and is home to most of the deepest mines in the world. With a vast supply of highly sought-after raw materials and a relatively low population density considering the space, South Africa has a thriving mining industry.

## How does the mining sector impact the South African economy?
The mining sector, which was formerly dominating, now contributes to barely 8% of South Africa's GDP (GDP). Agriculture's and manufacturing's relative contributions have likewise decreased since the mid-twentieth century, while those in the other sectors have increased. Finance currently accounts for 20% of GDP, with the state accounting for 17%.
