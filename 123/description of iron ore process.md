The raw materials mix or "charge" enters the furnace from the top and hot air is blown or blasted from the bottom causing the coke to burn and the oxygen to combine with carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide. Now, this carbon monoxide that is unstable, reacts with the ore to form carbon dioxide and iron. The Separation Of Iron-.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

The iron is poured into the stacks along with coke (carbon-rich coal) and limestone (calcium carbonate). Nowadays, the iron ore normally goes through a process of sintering before entering the stack. The sintering process forms pieces of ore that are 10-25mm, and these pieces are then mixed with coke and limestone.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

Description. Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH).n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

The rock is then crushed by powerful machinery. Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smel ting or electrolysis.
