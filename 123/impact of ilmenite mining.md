## Sand mining
Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight.

Aug 15, 2022Lithium is the most commonly used metal for new energy applications in the world. In the global electric vehicle industry, lithium batteries are widely used. Although the lithium battery as a new energy has a significant development status. But it has to be mentioned that many people remain concerned about the impact of lithium resource mining on the environment.

## Ilmenite
Distinguishing features . Ilmenite is often recognised in many altered igneous rocks (which is most, to some extent) by the production of the white pseudo-mineral leucoxene.Often, ilmenites are rimed in leucoxene, which allows ilmenite to be distinguished from magnetite and other iron-titanium oxides. The example shown in the image at right is typical of leucoxene-rimed ilmenite.

## Ilmenite: An ore of titanium | Uses and Properties - Geology
Ilmenite has a high resistance to weathering. When rocks containing ilmenite weather, grains of ilmenite disperse with the sediment. The high specific gravity of these grains causes them to segregate during stream transport and accumulate as "heavy mineral sands." These sands are black in color and easily recognized by geologists.
