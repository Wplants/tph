Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.
