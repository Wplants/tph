## ♨️Climb vs Conventional Milling [ Advantages & Disadvantages ]
They're one and the same: Climb Milling = Down Milling. Conventional Milling = Up Miling. Climb milling is when the direction of cut and rotation of the cutting tool combine to try to "suck" the mill up over (hence it's called "climb" milling) or away from the work. It produces the best surface finish.
