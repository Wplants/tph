## Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and Industrial applications - FillPlas
The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry, either as a building material, or limestone aggregate for road building, as an ingredient of cement. Or as the starting material for the preparation of builders' lime by burning in a kiln.

## Fillers for papermaking: A review of their properties, usage practices 
Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) Starting in the early 1980's, precipitated calcium carbonate has grown from relative obscurity to become by far the most widely used filler for paper (Tøttrup 1999). This is especially true in the US, where PCC usage increased to about 70% of all of the filler use by mass (Gill 2004).

The present invention provides a process for preparing a precipitated calcium carbonate product comprising the steps of: (a) preparing an aqueous suspension of precipitated calcium carbonate seeds by carbonating a suspension of Ca(OH) 2 in the presence of to moles of Sr, in the form of Sr(OH) 2, per mole of Ca(OH) 2, (b) dewatering and dispersing the precipitated calcium

## Calcium Carbonate - Formula, Structure, Properties and Uses - VEDANTU
Calcium Carbonate is a chemical compound having the chemical formula CaCO3. It is a white and insoluble powder-like substance that occurs naturally in minerals, marble, chalk, limestone, shells, calcite, pearl, and other related compounds. Medicinally, we use it as an antacid or a calcium supplement. It can also be used as cosmetics fillers.
