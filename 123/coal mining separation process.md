## What comes first when conducting a mining operation?
What is the process of mining minerals? The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock to remove the desired mineral ore. The ore is then crushed into finely ground tailings for chemical processing and separation to extract the target minerals.  Each component of a drilling fluid has a different chemical function.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Coal preparation plant
The coal delivered from the mine that reports to the coal preparation plant is called run-of-mine, or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground
