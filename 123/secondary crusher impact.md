## Selecting A Secondary Crusher: What Is the Right Choice?
The impact crusher adopts the principle of impact crushing. When it runs, the material is repeatedly impacted and crushed between the hammer and the impact plate. Whereas the cone one crushes the material by laminated crushing. Its rolling wall continuously moves toward the crushing wall, and the material sandwiched between the two is thereby smashed.

The simplest form of secondary crushing stage involves a single crusher, taking its feed by gravity flow direct from the primary with no interposed scalping separation. This is tantamount to making the over-all reduction in one machine, except of course that there will always be a certain amount of surge capacity between the two crushers.
