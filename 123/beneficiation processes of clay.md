## Graphite Beneficiation Process and Equipment - Xinhai
Graphite beneficiation processes can be divided into three types, namely flotation and gravity separation. Because graphite has natural floatability, silicate minerals such as clay, quartz, mica, and feldspar can be excluded by flotation. Because of the difference in density of different minerals, when using gravity separation to separate

## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream . There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
