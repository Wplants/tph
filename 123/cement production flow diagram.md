At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and ready to produce concrete. The first step in the process of making concrete is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel in the proportion of 15%, 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. This mixture is then put into a concrete mixer to produce concrete, which is used for building purposes.
