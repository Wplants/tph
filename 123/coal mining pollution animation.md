Coal mining has been around since the 1300's. Since then, technology has changed and is still booming in today's society. It was approximately around the late 1800's that coal became a significant resource in generating electricity. The differences in coal mining today and back then were tremendously different. Many men worked underground

The main components in coal. Carbon, the primary substance in coal, is what makes it economically desirable. In BC's coals, fixed carbon comprises from 27% to an impressive 85% of the coal. The more carbon, the more valuable the coal. Air-dried anthracite from the Klappan coalfield is over 85% fixed carbon - the diamond of coals.

Two basically different methods are used: longwall and room-and-pillar mining. In longwall mining all coal is recovered from the mined panels; hence, subsidence occurs at the surface

## Ecological coal mining based dynamic equilibrium strategy to reduce 
1. Introduction. The significant water, soil and air pollution produced as a result of coal mining activities has deepened the conflicts between the environment and human activities, constraining economic and social development (Tiwary, 2001; Bian et al., 2009, Zhengfu et al., 2010).The main five coal producing countries: China, the U.S., India, Australia, and Indonesia: provide almost 80.5%

## Coal and Air Pollution | Union of Concerned Scientists
This air pollution includes: Mercury: Coal plants are responsible for 42 percent of US mercury emissions, a toxic heavy metal that can damage the nervous, digestive, and immune systems, and is a serious threat to the child development. Just 1/70th of a teaspoon of mercury deposited on a 25-acre lake can make the fish unsafe to eat.
