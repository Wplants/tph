## Equations for enhancing cutting efficiency | Cutting Tool Engineering
When attempting to reduce cycle time, the first reaction is often to increase the cutting speed and feed rate. According to the feed rate formula (rpm × no. of cutting edges × chip load = ipm), an increase in rpm while maintaining the chip load yields a faster feed rate, which means the machine gets a part done faster.
