## What is Iron Ore? - WorldAtlas
Iron ore refers to rocks or minerals from which metallic iron is extracted for commercial use. These minerals appear dark grey to rusty red in color, and are usually rich in iron oxides. Iron occurs in these ores in the form of such chemical compounds as hematite, magnetite, siderite, limonite, or geothite.

Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.
