## Solid Waste Management in Africa: Governance Failure or  - IntechOpen
With weak waste collection systems and disposal of waste to uncontrolled and controlled dumpsites, the leakage of plastic into the environment poses a significant threat to the environment and economies [29, 30]. This is compounded by the lack of recycling in Africa. Improper waste management has serious health and environmental consequences.

Developing countries often lack the necessary regulations which govern the handling and disposal of waste, and even where they exist, these laws are poorly enforced (UN-Habitat, 1996; Segosebe and Van der Post, 1990). This view is affirmed by the findings of Stren and White (1998) who investigated waste management in East Africa.
