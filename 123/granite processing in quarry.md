Assessment of occupational exposure in a granite quarry . As granite can also present a variable, and occasionally significant, content of naturally occurring radionuclides, they may also face a radiological hazard. In order to assess the risk, a granite industry with a quarry and processing factory was selected to assess the occupational exposure.

## What is Quarried Granite? How Your Countertops Are Made
To separate the granite from the bedrock, carefully placed explosives blast it away. After it is extracted, the blocks will later be cut into slabs using machinery. Granite is an example of dimension stone - stone that has been quarried to obtain blocks or slabs that meet specifications for size and shape. Where is Granite Quarried?

Step 2: Processing. After the blocks are extracted from the quarry, they'll go through further processing to match their intended purpose. Thereafter rough blocks take shape from wire saw dressing machine and become ready to cut in Gaspari gang saw, which uses multiple diamond-tipped blades to slice a granite block into manageable slabs.
