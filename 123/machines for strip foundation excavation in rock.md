## Strip foundations | European Construction Costs
Strip foundations consist of a continuous strip, usually of concrete, formed centrally under load bearing walls. This continuous strip serves as a level base upon which the wall is built and is of such a width as is necessary to spread the load on the foundations to an area of subsoil capable of supporting the load without undue compaction.

The first step would be to blast it. The preferable way to do this is to excavate far enough down so there is a generous layer of dirt above the rock. This layer of dirt will act as a blanket, keeping the blasted rock from becoming airborne and potentially causing damage. From here, the rock will be removed from the ground.

A strip foundation is a shallow linear foundation that supports load-bearing structures such as walls. This type of foundation shifts deformation constantly and is therefore very stable during an earthquake. A foundation transfers the load from a structure to the ground beneath it.

## Foundation Excavation Process - A Solid Base for Your Building
Excavation is the equipment-heavy task of removing the earth from the allotted area in order to make room for the foundation. Depending on the depth and hardness of the soil, the trench may need to be reinforced as earth is removed. If the earth is extremely loose, planking will be put in place to hold the sides until the foundation can be poured.

## Types of Foundations & Methods of Construction of Foundations
Steel Grillage Foundation Method of construction of steel grillage foundation: For constructing steel grillage foundation, a trench is excavated to the calculated width and about 0.90 m - 1.50 m deep. Bottom of the trench is rammed and leveled. Then a layer of lean cement concrete (1: 8 : 16), about 30cm thick, is laid and compacted.
