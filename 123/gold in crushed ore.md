## How gold is extracted by Cyanidation Process - Refresh Science
The chemical that is used in the separation of gold from a rock is mercury. After the rock containing gold has been crushed to powder form, mercury is added to get the gold from the powder. Gold is dissolved in mercury to form an amalgam, just like the other minerals. In addition to that, using the cyanide solvent, gold is dissolved from its ore.

Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

At present, the maximum size of ore mined in the open pit site is 1000mm~1500mm, and the maximum size of ore mined in the underground is 300mm~600mm. Such large ore cannot be directly separated because useful minerals and gangue minerals are in a close symbiotic state.

2. Ancient placer gold ore. The ancient placer gold ore is the petrified placer ore, which is composed of the petrolized gravel. The particle size of 80% ore is between 75-100 microns. And this type of ore has a high grade. Gravity separation and cyanidation is a better process for gold extraction.
