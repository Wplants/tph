## Fiber Reinforced Concrete Using Waste Marble Aggregate
The use of waste plastic in concrete has greater significance because of the reduction in pollution caused by them. 1.1 Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Concrete The term fiber reinforced concrete is very familiar to us. the use of two or more type of fibers results in hybrid fiber reinforced concrete.

## Fiber-Reinforced Concrete | Construction Materials - CEMEX USA
There are four primary categories for fiber-reinforced concrete based on the material used to produce the fiber. Type I: Steel Fiber-Reinforced Concrete- stainless steel, alloy steel, or carbon steel fibers conforming to ASTM A820. Type II: Glass Fiber-Reinforced Concrete- alkali-resistant glass fibers in accordance with ASTM C1666.

Both traditional cast and GFRC can use recycled aggregates. Steel reinforcing is more green than AR glass fibers, since steel is the most recycled material. Therefore steel's use in concrete of any form boosts the concrete's green-ness. Interesting Facts. GFRC was first created in the 1940s in Russia.

Date: 11/1/2018. Abstract: An investigation was carried out on basalt fiber-reinforced concrete (BFRC) produced using various dosages of basalt fibers. The concrete mixture was designed with a target strength of 35 MPa (5075 psi), which is a typical strength for floor slabs and similar applications in which fiber reinforcement is often used.

The increase of fiber content will yield an increase in the toughness index and postcrack resistance, and lightweight aggregate fiber-reinforced concrete beams can sustain large loads and greater deflections, indicating strain hardening. Fibers with a length of 50 mm (2 inch) show the best improvement of toughness.

Fiber reinforcing has no impact on the air content of concrete compared to the same sample of non-fiber concrete, but the impact on slump is significant. The use of fiber generally will decrease the same sample by 2 inches. In some cases, the use of a high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWRA) may be needed to improve workability.
