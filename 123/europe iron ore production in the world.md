## The world's largest iron ore producing countries in 2021 - report
USGS said that increases in production, shipments, and trade of iron ore in 2021 were due to recovery from the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which lowered steel production and consumption globally in 2020. With 900 million tonnes of usable iron ore mined in 2021, Australia is the largest iron ore producing country, followed by Brazil

Although iron ore production was widely distributed, taking place in about 48 countries ( Jorgenson, 2008 ), the bulk of world production came from just a few countries. The five largest producers in the year 2007, in decreasing order of production of gross weight of ore, were China (33%), Brazil (18%), Australia (15%), India (8%) and Russia (6%).

Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.
