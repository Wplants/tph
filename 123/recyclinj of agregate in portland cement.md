## Recycling of Concrete (Recycling Coarse Aggregate) - IJERT
Recycling of concrete is a simple process. It involves breaking, removing, and crushing existing concrete into a material with a specified size and quality. As per study about 75 to 80% of total construction material consist coarse aggregate portion. When the structure is demolished, the waste concrete in a large quantity is produced.
