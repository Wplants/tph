## Environmental impacts of quarrying industry | World Problems & Global 
Although mine operations generally involve a small area, their local impact on biodiversity can be quite intense. All forms of open-pit mining, sand mining and quarrying totally destroy the local habitat. Slag and water-table disturbances and stream pollution from underground mining are also widespread and may be equally destructive.

Background: Stone quarrying is one of the major practices carried out in the world by the construction industry. In Kenya and specifically in Mandera County area, stone quarrying industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Objective: This study thus aims at examining the impact that stone quarrying has had on the environment and the livelihood of the communities in Mandera County, Kenya.

## Environmental Impacts Of Mining Natural Aggregate | SpringerLink
The most obvious environmental impact of aggregate mining is the conversion of land use, most likely from undeveloped or agricultural land use, to a (temporary) hole in the ground. This major impact is accompanied by loss of habitat, noise, dust, blasting effects, erosion, sedimentation, and changes to the visual scene.

The deafening sound of the machinery used in mining and the blasting cannot be considered as minor impacts either because they create conditions that may become unbearable for the local populations and the forest wildlife. It is argued that mining is vital for industrialization, because it provides raw material and sources of energy.

## The impact of mining on sustainable practices and the traditional 
A report by UNDP and UN Environment ( 2018) shows how mining has both positive and negative implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particularly strong impacts on 11 out of the 17 SDGs. Nearly two-thirds of the countries in the world have been classified resource-rich, but they have remained low income in the last 25 years.
