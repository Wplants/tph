## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Both the spring and hydraulic cone crusher designs are still in use today. Cone crushers are capable of crushing all types of medium to hard mineral rocks and stones. It also offers many advantages over other crusher designs, such as low energy consumption, reliability, high efficiency (compared to other crushers), and a high reduction ratio (feed/input size compared to product/output size).

## How Does the Cone Crusher Work?
Cone crusher is mostly used to crush medium-hard materials. In fact, the appearance of the cone crusher doesn't look like a cone. It is surrounded with several industrial-strength springs. The cone crusher is named after its inner-workings. Cone crusher has a large opening which is used to feed in materials, when materials are poured into the opening, then the central shaft and the crushing plate will work together to break down the materials.

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
