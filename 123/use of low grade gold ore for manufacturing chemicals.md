## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores | Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Steel manufacturing process pptht.shop
Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

## How to Effectively Identify the Gold Ore? | Fote Machinery
Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.
