The levelized plant cost was computed using the following fuel prices: $2.94/MMBtu for coal and $6.13/MMBtu for natural gas. The levelized coal plant costs are about 8.2 cents per kWh and for natural gas combined cycle 5.76 cents per kWh. Coal-fired electricity generation is far cleaner today than ever before.

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.

## Limestone Used In Coal Power Plants
Use Of Limestone Resources In Fluegas Desulfurization . In 1994, more than 41 of the approximately 160 coal-fired, electrical- power plants within the six-state Ohio River Valley region used flue-gas desulfurization FGD units to desulfurize their emissions, an approximately 100 increase over the number of plants using FGD units in 1989.
