Abstract. Environmental degradation resulting from mining activities is mostly attributed to illegal small-scale mining. As small-scale illegal gold mining in Ghana customarily involved the use of basic tools such as pickaxes, shovels, spades, chisels and hammers by unskilled personnel with little or no education to excavate gold or gold bearing rocks from the earth, it accounts for

## Effects of illegal mining on the agriculture sector in Ghana.
In Ghana, small-scale mining was regularised in 1989, and over 1.5 million troy ounces of gold and 8.0 million carats of diamonds have been produced by the sector. By the end of 2001, 420 small-scale mining concessions had been licensed, generating over 100,000 miners in the country (Amankwah and Anim-Sackey, 2003). The Act was repealed in 2006.

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.
