## What is the extraction process of platinum? - TeachersCollegesj
What is the extraction process of platinum? Modern Platinum Mining Techniques. Most of the mining for platinum ore occurs deep underground. To extract the mineral-rich materials, miners pack explosives into holes drilled in the rock and blast it into smaller pieces. The broken rock is then collected and transported to the surface for processing.

Benefits of Open Pit Mining. Open pit mining (also known as strip mining) is the process of extracting ore, minerals and/or fossil fuels that occurs on the surface of a particular mining site. When considering all the mining operations in the world, at least 40 percent of mining takes place at the surface reports Greenpeace International.

The mine walls are drilled and explosives are placed inside. Once detonated, the broken rock containing the platinum and other metals is transported to the surface for processing. The ore is crushed then subjected to 'froth floatation', and the resulting 'soapy' residue is heated up to 1,500 degrees Celsius.

The first step in this process is to crush platinum containing ore and immerse it in the reagent containing water; a process known as 'froth flotation'. During flotation, air is pumped through the ore-water slurry. Platinum particles chemically attach on to the oxygen and rise to the surface in a froth that is skimmed off for further refining.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.
