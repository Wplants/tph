## Cement Manufacturing Process - Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## How Is Limestone Quarried - Realonomics
How Is Limestone Quarried? Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining. . The basic operations in underground mining are drilling blasting loading and hauling scaling and roof bolting.

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing. Limestone quarries are opencast mines. Often limestone appears as an outcrop right on the surface. At other times it is under an overburden that can vary in depth but is generally less than 3 metres thick.

The market for limestone is remarkably consistent. Quarried limestone can be used to neutralize acidity, so it can be added to soils or lakes. Limestone is used in the iron manufacturing industry, is required for cement, concrete, and mortar mixes, and is heated with sand and sodium carbonate to create glass. 3. It is extremely affordable.
