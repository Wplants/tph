## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

## Artisanal and Small-scale Mining in Africa: Opportunities and  - SAIIA
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a thorny issue for both governments and large scale mining (LSM) companies.  In Zimbabwe, for example, artisanal diamond miners in the Marange area increased from a handful in 2004 to an estimated 35 000 in 2007. In Ghana ASM contributed 9% of total gold production in 2000, but by 2010 this had risen

In the 1990s, Zimbabwe was at the forefront of supporting small-scale mining as a livelihood option. This was a response to the growth of illegal alluvial panning, with the idea that upgrading and formalising would create more viable and long-term sources of employment and livelihood.
