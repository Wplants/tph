## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

Ball bearings are rolling element bearings that use balls to separate the bearing races and provide smooth, low friction motion in rotary applications. Ball bearings are manufactured in hundreds of sizes, from the ultra-small 1.50 mm diameter bearing for use with miniaturized medical devices and micro-motors, to bearings over 15 feet in diameter for use in heavy equipment.

## The Ultimate Guide to Ball Mills
The smooth ball mill liner is used for the fine grinding bin, and the rising height of the grinding media depends on thestatic friction coefficient with the ball mill liner. The strip ball mill liner is used in the first bin, which can make the grinding mediarise higher and have greater impact energy.

If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.
