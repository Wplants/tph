## Casting
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process.Casting materials are usually metals or various time setting materials that cure after mixing two or more

## The Secrets of Investment Casting - Foundry Management & Technology
Generally, investment casting is a simple process: Working from a master pattern, a mold is made from which a series of wax or ceramic patterns are produced. These patterns are arranged into one complex assemblage, and this cluster is given a refractory ceramic coating. Once the requisite coating thickness is achieved and the ceramic is

## Die Casting Process: Definition, Components, Types, Working 
Die Casting Process is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing the molten metal into a mold cavity under the application of high pressure or under gravity. Because of the metal mold, the same mold can be used for producing the infinite number of castings, hence the process is also called a Permanent Mold Casting Process.

## Continuous Casting Machines and their Types - IspatGuru
Continuous casting (CC) is a process of producing an infinite solid strand from liquid steel by continuously solidifying it as it moves through a CC machine. It is the predominant process route in a modern steel plant which links steelmaking with hot rolling of steel. In the CC machine, the liquid steel is solidified into a semi-finished steel
