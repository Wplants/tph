## Compressed Air Basics | AIChE
An air compressor increases the pressure of inlet air by reducing its volume. The majority of air compressors have, at their core, either centrifugal impellers or rotary screws ( Figure 1) that compress the air. By the very physics and thermodynamics involved, compressing air is naturally inefficient.

## Internal Combustion Engine Basics | Department of Energy
Combustion, also known as burning, is the basic chemical process of releasing energy from a fuel and air mixture. In an internal combustion engine (ICE), the ignition and combustion of the fuel occurs within the engine itself. The engine then partially converts the energy from the combustion to work.
