## in which power plants coal is mainly used
 · Natural gas is used in steam turbines and gas turbines to generate electricity. Coal was the third-largest energy source for U.S. electricity generation in 2020—about 19%. Nearly all coal-fired power plants use steam turbines. A few coal-fired power plants convert coal to a gas for use in a gas turbine to generate electricity.

## Conventional Coal-Fired Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
Coal combustion causes several environmental issues. There have been numerous improvements for reducing harmful emissions to the atmosphere, such as setting up of flue gas scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators in conventional coal-fired power plants.Compared to combustion, gasification of coal can yield syngas (mainly H 2 and CO) with some other impurities.

A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.
