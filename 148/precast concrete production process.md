## Manufacturing Impacts: Natural Stone vs. Precast Concrete
Feb 24, 2022As the graph below demonstrates, precast concrete has a higher global warming potential (GWP) than natural stone. Every step in the precast concrete manufacturing process requires the use of a lot of energy, which contributes to a large GWP. The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to carbon dioxide (CO2) over the

Step 7: Curing the Concrete. The final step of pouring concrete is curing. This process begins as soon as the concrete is mixed, but can take several months to fully complete. The goal of curing is to maintain enough moisture for the hydration process to continue, which leads to stronger concrete.

## Precast concrete
Precast concrete is a construction product produced by casting concrete in a reusable mold or "form" which is then cured in a controlled environment, transported to the construction site and maneuvered into place; examples include precast beams, and wall panels for tilt up construction. In contrast, cast-in-place concrete is poured into site-specific forms and cured on site.

Forms. Precast forms are normally made of either steel or plywood. A large number of castings in forms is typical in the production of precast concrete elements in plants with savings of raw materials. Plywood form use is limited to about 20 to 50 castings depending upon the complexity, maintenance and shape of the form.

The concrete mix strongly affects the aesthetics - the surface - of the product. The mix also determines the product's structural quality (load bearing capacity). Concrete is the primary cost factor in most precast products. The concrete mix and its curing process determine the length of the production cycle.

Introduction - Inspections are an essential part of the precast concrete production process. Items such as sound walls, traffic barriers, and retaining walls are a few types of precast concrete products. Precast concrete differs from standard poured concrete in that the concrete is cast into forms in a shop, allowed to cure, and transported to the job site for erection.

## Why precast concrete structures are preferred to cast-in-situ?
Score: 4.5/5 (66 votes) . Because precast concrete is more easily controlled, the quality and durability is typically much better than cast-in-place concrete.A precast manufacturer is also more likely to receive greater discounts on materials due to the volume of purchases that can be made for multiple projects at a time.

## Precast Concrete Fabrication Techniques | Permacast Walls
Pouring concrete is a messy process that is often subjected to the surrounding environmental conditions, including weather and the surrounding area. However, when products are pre-designed in-house, the outcome is far more predictable and the amount of waste becomes negligible, creating a more efficient production process all the way around.
