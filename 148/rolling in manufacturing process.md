## Rolling Process: Types, Working, Terminology and Application
Rolling is a major manufacturing process of sheets and other cross sections of large length like I beam, railroads etc. It is one of a metal forming process in which the metal work piece is compressed between a set of rolls where it reduces its cross section area and increases its length. This process gives high production rate, surface finish

## Rolling Process: Definition, Working Principle, Application, and 
Rolling Process Definition. The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.

## Thread Rolling Manufacturing- Introduction, Principle
Thread rolling is a cold-forming process by which straight or tapered threads are formed on round rods or wire. The threads are formed on the rod or wire with each stroke of a pair of flat reciprocating dies (Fig.). Flat Thread Rolling Processes. In another method, threads are formed with rotary dies (Fig. ), at production rates as high as 80

## Aluminium foil manufacturing process
The aluminium foil manufacturing process consists of smelting, rough rolling, intermediate rolling and aluminum foil blank rolling. Smelting. Aluminium ingots are placed into the furnace to get smelted, and aluminium liquid flows into the casting mill through the launder, during which the the refiner A1-Ti-B is added to form a continuous and
