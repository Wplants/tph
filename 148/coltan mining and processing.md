Dec 1, 2020In the field, the recovery rates associated with artisanal coltan mining and processing are frequently estimated at around 50% or less. This is due to the prevalence of the ground sluicing technique commonly employed by artisanal coltan miners, combined with the lack of grade monitoring for pre-concentrate products and tailings at the mine
