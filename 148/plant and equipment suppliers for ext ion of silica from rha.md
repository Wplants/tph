## Process development of silica extraction from RHA: a cradle to gate 
India is one of the major rice-producing countries. Rice husk is a major agricultural by-product from rice production, which is used as a fuel in boilers. Its use as fuel produces huge amounts of silica-rich rice husk ash (RHA). This paper aims at providing an overall assessment of environmental impacts associated with the extraction of silica from RHA—a process developed by our study group

## Silica depleted rice hull ash (SDRHA), an agricultural waste, as a high 
Rice hull ash (RHA, an agricultural waste) produced during combustion of rice hulls to generate electricity consists (following dilute acid leaching) of high surface area SiO 2 (80-90 wt%) and 10-20 wt% carbon (80 m 2 g −1 total). RHA SiO 2 is easily extracted by distillation (spirosiloxane) producing SDRHA, which offers an opportunity to develop "green" hybrid lithium-ion capacitors

In such a case, added ions may have a very strong effect (42). The basis of these effects is the fact that proteins generally carry a negative charge in the pH region 5-7 and, therefore, are capable of binding the ions. In addition, the small ions alter the conformations and stabilizing properties of the adsorbed protein layer (43).
