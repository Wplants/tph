Feb 5, 2021Cement Kilns: Plant Layout. The basic layout of a cement plant has been as above since the early nineteenth century. Two raw materials - one high in calcium and one low in calcium - are crushed, then finely ground together in a rawmill to make "rawmix".The rawmix is burned in a kiln with fuel to make clinker.The clinker is finely ground with a small addition of gypsum in a finish mill

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Abstract. Cement production is an energy-intensive process. The cost of energy constitutes more than 60% of the cost of the cement; hence cement plants have to consider minimizing the cost of energy when planning production. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the production plan.

Summary of production process. Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of
