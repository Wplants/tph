## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Abstract. Cement production is an energy-intensive process. The cost of energy constitutes more than 60% of the cost of the cement; hence cement plants have to consider minimizing the cost of energy when planning production. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the production plan.
