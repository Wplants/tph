Chemical Processing of Phosphate - Florida Industrial and  Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid.

Nov 30, 2021Phosphate rock contains the mineral phosphorus, an ingredient used in some fertilizers to help plants grow strong roots. Phosphate rock contains small amounts of naturally-occurring radionuclides, mostly uranium and radium. When processing phosphate rock to make fertilizer, the phosphorous is removed by dissolving the rock in an acidic solution.

Commercial fertilizer it is mostly soluble P (in the form of phosphate). Within 24 hours this soluble P starts being converted to labile P and eventually to stable P. What this means is that most of the phosphorus fertilizer you add to the soil is available to plants for a short period of time, and then it gets locked away in the soil.

## Phosphate Rock Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases
The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.

How phosphate is mined and processed. Therefore, spreading phosphate rock on fields had little effect on plant growth. However, in the mid-1800s, chemists discovered that mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock would make a soluble fine powder called superphosphate; this discovery turned phosphate rock into the valuable fertilizer it is today.
