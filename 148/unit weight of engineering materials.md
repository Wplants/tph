The specific weight, also known as the unit weight, is the weight per unit volume of a material.. A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at 4 °C (39 °F), which is 9.807 kilonewtons per cubic metre or 62.43 pounds-force per cubic foot.. Often a source of confusion is that the terms specific gravity, and less often specific weight, are also used for relative density.

Definition. A newton is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s 2 (it is a derived unit which is defined in terms of the SI base units). One newton is therefore the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force.

## Properties of Engineering Materials: General, Physical and Mechanical
The property of a material to absorb heat is known as its thermal capacity and it is worked out by the following equation -. T = H / M (T 2 - T 1) Where, T = Thermal capacity in J/N °C. H = Quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of material from T 1 to T 2 in J M = Mass of material in N.
