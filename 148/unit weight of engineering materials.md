Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.

The specific weight, also known as the unit weight, is the weight per unit volume of a material.. A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at 4 Â°C (39 Â°F), which is 9.807 kilonewtons per cubic metre or 62.43 pounds-force per cubic foot.. Often a source of confusion is that the terms specific gravity, and less often specific weight, are also used for relative density.

RE: weight of building materials. SlideRuleEra (Structural) 6 Dec 15 23:01. The weight of galvanized coating, including hot-dip, can usually be ignored. The coating weighs a few ounces per square foot (such as 1, 2 or 3 oz/ ft 2 ). Just use the weight of the plain steel, even for thin sheets which are, of course, coated on both sides.

## Properties of Engineering Materials: General, Physical and Mechanical
The property of a material to absorb heat is known as its thermal capacity and it is worked out by the following equation -. T = H / M (T 2 - T 1) Where, T = Thermal capacity in J/N Â°C. H = Quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of material from T 1 to T 2 in J M = Mass of material in N.
