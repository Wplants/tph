## A Trend ? A Necessity? Iron Ore Beneficiation - Blogger
Iron ore beneficiation uses the fact that the physical and chemical properties of the ore mineral and the impurities differ. All this is done to ensure that the plant waste doesn't contain more than 45 percent Fe. A circuit is designed making use of different methods depending on type and source of the ore. Different methods employed by most

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
