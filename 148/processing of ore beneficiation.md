## Production process of lean magnetite ore beneficiation
Oct 25, 2021Production process of lean magnetite ore beneficiation. The lean magnetite ore in Anshan area is a lean magnetite ore with high silicon and low sulfur and phosphorus. The content of red and limonite is low, and the content of iron silicate and iron carbonate is relatively high. At this time, many large-grained gangues can reach the monomer to

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step
