Child labour in a coal mine, United States, c. 1912. Photograph by Lewis Hine.  It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work. Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes.

## What are the Benefits of Coal? - Research Summary
Coal is one of the most controversial sources of modern energy. In America about 29% of the electricity we use is generated by power plants that burn coal. Coal is a plentiful but non-renewable resource. But coal is a form of carbon and when we burn coal we release carbon into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.

## Natural gas vs. Coal - a positive impact on the environment
Natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO 2) when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas-power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant. The amount of CO 2 produced when a fuel is burned is a function of the carbon content of the fuel. The heat content, or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is

Pennsylvania's economy has long been tied to its coal industry. In the 19th century the state's pioneering coal companies fueled America's industrial revolution, and thousands of mining sites opened over the decades that followed. Yet, over a century later, many of Pennsylvania's coal mines have closed as the resource's primacy has waned.
