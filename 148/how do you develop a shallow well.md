A well is the most common way to obtain groundwater for household use. A well is basically a hole in the ground, held open by a pipe (or casing) that extends to an aquifer. A pump draws water from the aquifer for distribution through the plumbing system. The depth to which wells are constructed is determined by factors such as 1) depth to

If it is small diameter, such as 1-1/4" PVC, that would indicate it is a shallow "well point" as they are called. If it is 2″ or above, it very well could be a deep well.

To properly drive your well point, the entire point must be below the water table or else the pump will only suck up air. Something to keep in mind, is that the water table will eventually lower as the pump runs, so the point will have to be lower than what the pump can draw the water table down to. To ensure good suction, make sure the entire
