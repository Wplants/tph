## Construction Waste Management
Construction & Demolition Waste. The growth in the construction industry triggers waste production to exponential levels. The waste generated from the construction industry is commonly called as Construction & Demolition Waste or C&D waste. Most of the waste materials in construction industries are non-biodegradable and inert materials.. Construction waste materials are heavy, dense, bulky in

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
