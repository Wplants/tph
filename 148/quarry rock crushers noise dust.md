## Quarries - A Solution or a Dust Problem? - Soil Solutions
Quarries. Stone quarrying is a process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into desired sizes. This screened aggregate is then used for the construction of roads, rail lines, bridges, hospitals, schools, airports, factories, and homes, all of which has crucial impact on economic

When the quarry is finished, the pumps are turned off and the water flows back in. When the water is exposed to the air, the CO2 degasses. This allows the pH to rise and for Calcium Carbonate to precipitate. The CaCO3 is very finely crystalline and remains suspended in the water column giving it that "Bahamian" blue color. One of the most popular rock quarries is the Eno near Durham, where

## How to Control Dust in Quarries | Quarrying & Aggregates
In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle â¥45Â°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.
