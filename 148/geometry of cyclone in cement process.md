## Cyclone Separator for Powder Processes - Hanningfield
The Cyclone Separator uses its geometry to separate the solid extracted material from the airstream. This vortex separation causes solid particles to hit the outside wall of the cyclone, de-accelerate and fall to the catch-pot at the base of the cyclone. The clean air then passes downstream to the dust extraction source.
