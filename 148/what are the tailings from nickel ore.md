As the ore is processed through the Bitumen Production facility, large volumes of process water are added to produce a slurry that can be gravity separated, recovering the bitumen and leaving behind coarse sand, fines and process water. This tailings stream is diverted to a storage facility where the solids settle over time, allowing the water to be reclaimed.
