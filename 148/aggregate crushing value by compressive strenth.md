Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate

## Aggregate Crushing Value | Aggregate Crushing Strength Test
There are a variety of parent rocks with compressive strengths ranging from 45MPa to 545Mpa.An aggregate sample's crushing value is determined by applying a gradually increasing compressive load to it. Test participants are typically required to pass 12.5 mm of aggregate and retain it on a 10mm sieve.
