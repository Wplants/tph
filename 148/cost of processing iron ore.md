## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

The scarcity of coking coals for blast-furnace use and the high cost of coke ovens are two reasons for the emergence of this other alternative iron-making process. Smelting reduction employs two units: in the first, iron ore is heated and reduced by gases exiting from the second unit, which is a smelter-gasifier supplied with coal and oxygen.

Mining (extraction), beneficiation, and processing of iron ore produces iron and steel. Mining is defined as removing ore material from a deposit and encompasses all activities prior to beneficiation. High grade iron ores (iron content greater than 62 %) are simply crushed, screened and shipped directly to the iron making unit (e.g. blast furnace).

The estimated greenhouse gas emissions were 11.9 kg CO 2 e for mining and processing 1 tonne of iron ore. The embodied energy values were 153 MJ/t ore for iron ore. The results showed that loading and hauling made the largest contributions (approximately 50%) to the total greenhouse gas emissions from the mining and processing of iron ore.
