## What is Cement Clinker? Composition, Types & Uses - Civil Engineering
Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary

With clinker cooler problems, extremely high clinker temperatures exceeding 400 °C must be expected. For these high temperatures, clinker silos are preferably made of steel; otherwise the choice of steel or concrete depends on economical aspects. In certain regions steel plate silos can be produced at more favourable prices.

Step 2: clinker sintering. Clinker sintering is a crucial link in clinker calcination, which mainly occurs in the cement kiln. Inside the kiln, raw meals are heated by rising temperature and generate a series of physical and chemical reactions. When the temperature reaches its peak, the clinker will be produced by rapid cooling.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## Clinker Storage System - Understanding Business Analysis and 
Clinker storage. Clinker after cooling in the clinker cooler, is transported by metallic conveyors and stored either in open or covered areas for aging which improves the grinding efficiency in the subsequent operation in the cement mills and increases the mill output rate. The aging of clinker is commonly done for a period not less than 20 days.

Answer: Portland cement clinker is the material that gets ground up (possibly with gypsum and other small quantities of material) to become Portland cement. Clinker is in the form of rounded granules, typically 3 to 25mm diameter. Those granules are the sintered output from large rotary kilns.
