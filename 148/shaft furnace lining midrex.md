In a mini -mills, electricity is used to melt (primarily) scrap steel. The diagrams below show the steps that traditional steel mills must take, to make steel from ore, coke, and limestone. It also shows how mini -mills streamline this process considerably. Minimills make steel from scrap steel or scrap substitutes in an electric arc furnace (EAF).

The shaft furnace is where iron ore is converted to metallic. Iron oxide, in pellet or lump form, is introduced through a proportioning hopper at the top of the shaft furnace. As the iron ore descends through the furnace by gravity flow, it is heated, and the oxygen is removed from the iron ore (reduction) by counterflowing gases that have a
