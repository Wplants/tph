Lime and sodium cyanide are added to the tank, and compressed air is passed into the tank for leaching and adsorption. The activated carbon is added to the fully leaching slurry, and the activated carbon adsorbed the gold in the cyanide slurry and became the gold-bearing carbon. The leaching time is generally 24 hours to 48 hours.

## Sorting through the heap - Canadian Mining Journal
Sep 1, 2020One of the advantages of heap leaching versus conventional milling and using either carbon-in-pulp (CIP) or carbon-in-leach (CIL) for gold recovery is the lower cost. However, along with that lower cost comes a lower recovery rate. Gold recovery is also usually only about 55% to 75% compared with roughly 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant.
