## nickel processing - Extraction and refining | Britannica
The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

The earliest method of extraction was a method developed in the Mexican mines in the mid 1500s and familiar to the miners at Virginia City, the Patio Process. This method of processing the rocks to extract the silver was slow, did not recover all the silver, and did not use the added reagents as efficiently as possible.

## What is the process of extracting an ore?
Jun 23, 2022Extraction of metals. The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

## Diamond Mining Methods | Diamond Museum Cape Town
A single blast can break approx. 3,000 tonnes of ore. Once the ore is broken, excavators load the ore into haul trucks and transport it to a primary ore crusher where the diamond extracting process begins. The Kimberley Big Hole is an example of open-pit mining. In underground mining, miners tunnel through Earth's crust to the kimberlite pipe

The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent, loion and value of the ore body.
