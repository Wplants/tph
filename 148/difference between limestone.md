## Limestone vs Travertine | Best Masonry Contractor in Garland TX 
Apr 28, 2022The difference between travertine and limestone costs is negligible and depends a lot on the quality and where it is quarried from. The same is true for their longevity. Limestone, since it's harder and less porous, will usually last longer. But as natural stones, both have excellent durability and longevity.
