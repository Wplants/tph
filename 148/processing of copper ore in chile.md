## Geology of Copper | Properties, Mining, and Formation of Copper
3 days agoCopper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.
