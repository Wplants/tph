## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

Role of NaCN in the extraction of gold is as follows: NaCN is used in leaching of gold. In this process, finely powdered gold is treated with the dilute solution of NaCN, a current of air is passed. As a result, gold passes into solution forming soluble complex cyanides while the impurities remain unaffected which are filtered off.

The gold is mixed with the sodium cyanide which leads to the following Elsener's equation and reaction. This is done to make soluble gold; Now the gold is soluble. This method of making soluble gold is known as leaching. In the process of leaching, a dilute form of sodium cyanide is added into the ore containing the gold.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
