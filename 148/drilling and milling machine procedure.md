A drilling machine primarily works by drilling holes through wood, metal or other hard materials. On the other hand, a milling machine works only on metallic surfaces. Additionally, a drilling machine works by cutting onto the surfaces vertically, while a milling machine provides the advantages of both vertical and horizontal cuts simultaneously.

There are many machines capable and used to drill, ream or thread holes in a part. Drilling is the manufacturing process where a round hole is created within a work piece or enlarged by rotating an end cutting tool, a drill. Reaming is a similar process where a hole feature is enlarged to a very specific or accurate size by introducing a rotating end and side cutting tool called a reamer.

Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling - Trimantec
We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods. Metals, plastics, composites, and wood are all possible workpiece materials.

##  Safety Operating Procedures - Milling Machine
Keep clear of moving machine parts. Follow correct clamping procedures. Keep overhangs as small as possible and check workpiece is secure. Set the correct speed to suit the cutter diameter, the depth of cut and the material. ENDING OPERATIONS AND CLEANING UP. Switch off the machine when work completed. Remove milling cutters and store them safely.
