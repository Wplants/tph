About this Calculator. Metal equivalent calculations are often used to compare similar deposits with slightly different metal ratios: CuEq (copper equivalent) and AuEq (gold equivalent) are most common in copper porphyry deposits. Silver equivalent (AgEq) may be used in a silver mine with lead and zinc or other base metal credits.

## Iron ore: Grade is king - Eureka Report
Summary: The 'de-commoditisation' of iron ore has begun where the difference between ore quality-to-price must be paid more attention to than ever before.. Key take-out: Investors must better understand how iron ore is priced as low-grade ore receives a damaging discount.. Iron ore quality has emerged as a critical issue for Australian miners of the steel-making mineral.

## Cut-off grades - MiningMath
The concept of cut-off grade has been conceived to delineate what is ore and waste, considering the life of mine. Usually, manual assumptions are made to pre-define what must be considered ore or not, while using the LG or Pseudoflow methodologies.These approaches do not consider the value of the money through time in the decision-making process, which could generate a whole different mining

where fa is the annual fixed costs. For example, according to above equations 3, 4, and 5 the optimum cutoff grade for year 1 can be calculated as follows : F (l) = 0.15 x $413.8/1.05. F (l) = $58.56/ton of ore milled, Table 4 gives yearly tons and grade schedules resulting from optimum cutoff grades calculated for each year similar to year 1.

## cut off grade of iron ore
cut off grade of iron ore.  When cut-off grade increases, the tonnage of ore reserve that can be included as mineable ore reserve is reduced (Gerald, 1992).  Cut Off Grade Calculation Optimization. May 25, 2018 Cutoff grade is defined as the grade that is normally used to discriminate between ore and waste within a given orebody. Although
