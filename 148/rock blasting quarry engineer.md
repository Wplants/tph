## Quarry drill and blast: a vital first operation
Drilling and blasting is one of the first operations to be carried out in a quarry to gain the material for further processing. The vital process often starts with a detailed survey of the quarry face, which will enable the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled, enabling the task to be carried out safely and efficiently.

Rock fragmentation due to blasting depends upon many parameters. The properties of the explosive are one of them. In limestone quarries, ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) or site mixed emulsion (SME) are generally used for rock fragmentation. Both these explosives cause substantial changes in the breakage mechanism of rockmass thereby affecting the fragmentation. This paper reports the effect

The blasters and engineers later took over and modified powder factor to work better as they collected data. This was the only design approach until the 1870s, when the blasting world changed with the widespread adoption of dynamite.

##  Fatal Accidents Due To Flyrock And Lack Of Blast Area Security And 
Blasting generally has two purposes: rock fragmentation, and displacement of the broken rock. The movement of the blasted rock (also known as muckpile) depends on the shot-design parameters, geological conditions, and mining constraints. In some mining practices, it is desirable to throw or cast as much rock as possible to the spoil heap.

Rotary air blasting, or rotary blowing, is a type of rotary drilling that uses a blade bit or roller cone bit to cut and break rock with a simple blade mounted on the end of a rotating drill rod. This shaft is rotated while a thrust is applied to it by a trigger mechanism that uses up to 65 percent of the machine's weight.
