## Compaction properties of different soils and suitable solutions
A summary of the compaction properties of fine-grained (cohesive) and coarse-grained (non-cohesive / granular) soils. Coarse-grained materials. They are relatively easy to compact, especially by vibration, and have a high bearing capacity. Free draining soils are not susceptible to ponding and freezing. Fine granulation materials

From the data represented on the table, the coefficient of permeability Hydraulic Conductivity k = 0.012 cm/sec (1.2 x 10-4 msec). Permeability is important because of the following reasons: Underground seepage study is an important aspect of all the Civil Engineering works because once a foundation is laid, you don't want the soil mass holding your foundation to leak water.

Below 1, ASTM specifies grain sizes of 0 and 00, both of which have less than 1 grain per square inch at 100x magnification. Annealing can sometimes make a material's grains grow to 00 or even larger. Any bends placed in that material will be susceptible to tears or cracks on the outside of the bend radius.

Sep 15, 2021Ionic liquid (IL) materials are promising electrolytes with striking physicochemical properties for energy and environmental applications. Heterogeneous structures and transport quantities of monomeric and polymeric ILs are intrinsically intercorrelated and span multiple spatiotemporal scales, which is more feasible for coarse-grained (CG) simulations than atomistic modelling.

## Cyclic behaviour of coarse-grained materials exposed to freeze-thaw 
1. Introduction. China has been undergoing a high-speed railway (HSR) building boom over the past decade. At the end of 2018, China had the world's longest HSR network, with over 29,000 km of track in operation, accounting for >60% of the HSR distance in the world, and a total distance of 36,000 km has been planned to complete construction before 2020.
