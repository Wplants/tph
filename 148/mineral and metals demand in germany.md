## Demand for rare minerals and metals creates eco-dilemma
Jan 21, 2022The Minerals Education Coalition has calculated that in the course of his or her lifetime, the average American will need almost 1,500 tons of metals, minerals and fuels. The Norwegian sustainable development index demonstrates that the country is one of those with the deepest materials footprints per head of population.

## Booming demand for critical minerals could harm the environment, not 
Jul 2, 2021Published Friday, July 2, 2021. Increasing demand from the renewable energy industry for rare earth minerals is set to grow to unsustainable levels, data shows. Experts predict major deficits in mineral supply. Hasty decisions to expand mining in the wrong places could harm the environment and undo efforts to protect it by reducing emissions.
