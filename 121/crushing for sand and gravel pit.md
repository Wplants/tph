## Opinion: Living near a gravel pit
The noise at times coming from the gravel pit is at best annoying and at worst fist clenching. Summer time is the worst. I was used to a peaceful, quiet surrounding and had no idea that the crushing would be taking place all through the night. When the gravel pit comes to life at night, all you hear is the constant whirrrrrr of the crushers.
