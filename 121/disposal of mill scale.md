## Mill Scale Removal Made Easy! - Dustless Blasting
Mill scale is a tough layer of iron oxides and magnetite which coats the surface of hot rolled steel. It is necessary to remove mill scale before welding or painting can occur, but the process is usually difficult and time consuming. Our process eliminates mill scale quickly and efficiently, leaving a white metal finish.

## Recycling of steel plant mill scale via iron ore pelletisation process 
Abstract. Mill scale is an iron oxide waste generated during steelmaking, casting and rolling. Total generation of mill scale at JSWSL is around 150 t/day and contains 60-70%FeO and 30-35%Fe 2 O 3.To recover the iron, the mill scale must be smelted in a blast furnace or other reduction furnace; however, it is usually too fine to use without previous agglomeration such as via pellet or

## Mill Scale - Should Welders Remove It? - Welders Manual
Mill scale coatings are generally found on regular mild steel. This is the most common and affordable type of steel on the market. Cold rolled steel is a more expensive product, and it does have a light scale coating. However, it is nowhere near as thick as the scale on mild steel. Since it isn't rolled out using heat, the coating that is

Mill scale is iron oxide that is formed on a steel surface that has been hot rolled. During hot rolling, due to the high temperature involved, oxide is formed over the entire steel surface. The flaky surface increases as hot rolling progresses.  It's easy to operate and removes the need for enclosures, reprocessing or disposal of grit.

There are several ways to remove a mill-scale: Firstly, iIt can be done by grinding, shot blasting or chemical removal. Material with a mill-scale is also deliberately allowed to rust (oxidise). By oxidizing, the mill-scale dissolves more or less and can easily be removed by sanding. Another way of removing mill-scale is "drumming".
