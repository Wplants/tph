Vinegar alone is a weak acid so it won't work, as shown by beaker #2. Salt water also does not work, as shown in beaker #3. To clean the pennies, you need a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid. In beaker # 4, when you mix the vinegar and salt, you make hydrochloric acid. This dissolves the copper compound.

By Vanessa. Jun 9, 2022. Add 120 milliliters of hydrochloric acid for every ounce of gold in the container. For 5 ounces of gold, that would be 600 milliliters of HCL. The addition of hydrochloric acid turns the mixture brown and can result in fumes. As the chemicals react and heat up, the gold will dissolve.

It's important to add muriatic acid to your pool because it can help you balance pH levels when they have reached levels that are too high. The proper pH level ranges from 7.2-7.8, which means that the water is effectively balanced. If the pH levels drop below this number, the water has become acidic, which can introduce a wide range of problems to your pool water.

Jun 11, 2022Jun 11, 2022. Muriatic acid, better known today as hydrochloric acid, is a simple, corrosive liquid with well-studied chemical properties. When gold is subjected to treatment with muriatic acid alone, nothing happens. But when muriatic acid is combined with nitric acid to treat gold, the gold dissolves.

Concerned that your gold isn't living up to the hype? Take a tough metal file and scrape deep into it. Put the exposed area into several drops of acid for 30-60 seconds.

What is HCl Hydrochloric Acid. Hydrochloric acid is a colorless inorganic chemical system with the formula H 2 O:HCl.Hydrochloric acid has a distinctive pungent smell. It is mainly produced as a precursor to vinyl chloride for PVC.It is classified as strongly acidic and can attack the skin over a wide composition range, since the hydrogen chloride practically dissociates completely in solution.

## Muriatic Acid v. Dry Acid - Tropical Fiberglass Pools
Dry Acid is also known as Sodium Bisulfate. It is much safer to use than Muriatic Acid and comes in a granular form. It tends to be more expensive than Muriatic Acid, but for some, the ease in which you can use it, and the fact that it isn't quite so dangerous, is reason enough to justify the extra cost. At pool stores, it is usually called

## HYDROCHLORIC ACID | Gold Refining & Metal Extraction Forum
According to an internet source, the actual specific gravity of 30% (by weight) HCl is 1.145. Therefore, a liter weighs 1,145 gms. In one liter of 30%, by weight, HCl, the water content is 1145 X .70 = 801.5 grams or, 80.15%, by volume, since a ml of water weighs approx. 1 gram. So, 30% HCl, by weight, is the same as 19.85% HCl, by volume.
