## What Makes Recycled Crushed Concrete Good For Driveways? - Al Manaratain
The Advantages Of Crushed Concrete For Asphalt Driveways. The biggest advantage of using crushed concrete for asphalt driveways is the cost-effectiveness compared to just using new concrete. In general, using asphalt comes with much higher longevity and a more pleasant appearance than for example a gravel driveway, but overall it is more costly

Apr 22, 2022Crushed Stone #1: Approx. 2″-4″ Wide. Crushed stone grade no. 1 is the largest size with diameters ranging from around 2 inches to 4 inches. As this grade contains larger pieces, it's not suitable for shoveling and stones will need to be moved individually. Typical uses for gravel #1 include: Filling larger holes.

## What to use to harden up a gravel driveway
What shape is the gravel? Go look at railroad ballast, you want that stuff, aka "crushed stone", very jaggy and will interlock when tamped down. Very hard to shovel for that reason. You want a smaller size though. Any sort of round or half-round pea gravel type stuff has to go. Get a loader, shovel it outta there, save it for aggregate for concrete.

## Should I set fence posts in dirt, gravel, crushed rock, or concrete?
Answer (1 of 6): The answer depends on where you live. If you live someplace with heavy clay soil and a brutal freeze-thaw cycle, like I do, then pretty much everything is a better choice than concrete. Around here, the water is held against the post by the clay soil, then the freeze-thaw cycle

Best Practices: For use in trail surfacing, the material should be composed of irregular angular particles that interlock and bind into a firm matrix.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
