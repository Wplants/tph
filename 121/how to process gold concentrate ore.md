## how to process gold concentrate ore
 gold processing gold processing Mining and concentrating: The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.
