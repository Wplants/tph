## Crushed Aggregate - Meckley's Limestone Products, Inc.
Fine aggregate is broken up into smaller pieces than coarse aggregate. When put through a separator or aggregate washer, coarse crushed aggregate will pass through a 3-inch (7.62-cm) sieve but will not go through a No. 4 sieve. Fine crushed aggregate will pass through a No. 4 sieve but will be stopped by a No. 200 sieve during the aggregate
