## Crush and Run Instead of Gravel Under Slab - GreenBuildingAdvisor
I believe the recommended order of operations is, from bottom up: crush, foam, plastic, concrete. Hopefully no-one here is confusing washed stone with 'clean' crush stone. Clean, can of course mean different things, but sometimes simply means it's been screened/sorted. It merely has the fines that sticks to the stone after the screening process.

## Morrison Gravel - 3/8 Clean Aggregate
Description. 3/8" Clean Crushed Aggregate is a light gray colored rock the same size as peagravel but crushed instead of round. Since it is a clean crushed rock that does not contain any fines it will not pack in tightly like a 'minus' rock will. However it will drain better than a minus rock, and will stay in place better than a round rock.
