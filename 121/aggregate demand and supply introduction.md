## Aggregate Demand: Definiton, Examples & Theories - StudySmarter US
Aggregate demand is the total planned spending on the goods and services produced in the economy in a particular period (usually in a year). The four main sources of spending in the aggregate demand originate from different sectors of the economy. These are households, firms, the government, and exports and imports.

## Aggregate Supply vs. Aggregate Demand: What's the Difference?
Aggregate demand is the total demand for an economy's goods and services in a specified period like a week, month or year. This demand might come from consumers within the economy or from outside. For example, international demand for a nation's resources increases aggregate demand as does increased spending by people in that country.

Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Model. In order to understand how the economy works at the macro level, you need look no further than the Aggregate Demand (AD) - Aggregate Supply (AS) model. As with most economic concepts, generally speaking, the equilibrium point between AD and AS tells us a great deal.

Macroeconomics deals with aggregate economic quantities, such as national output and national income.

supply and demand, in economics, relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy. It is the main model of price determination used in economic theory. The price of a commodity is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market.

Keynesian economists emphasize Keynes' law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.
