## What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Mining?
Humans need a wide range of natural resources to create the products modern civilization needs. While alternative forms of energy are becoming more viable, most nations need coal, natural gas and uranium to provide energy. Similarly, oil is necessary for powering vehicles and the transportation industry. Mining allows humans to use these resources.
