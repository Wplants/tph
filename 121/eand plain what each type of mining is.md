## The Main Types of Mining and their Differences
The main difference between surface mining today and mining carried out in ancient times is the types of equipment used. As some minerals exist at the surface or just below ground, surface mining is still the most appropriate method for extracting them. Surface mining is also referred to as open-pit mining.

## What are the major types of mining and how do they differ from each 
Each type of mining is adopted for different geological conditions and done so in order to minimize costs and maximize profits for the company. Shallow deposits tend to be mined by surface methods - strip mines or open-pit mines. Deeper mineral deposits tend to be mined by underground mines.

Development mining is the initial phase of removing the non-valuable components such as rock to access the targeted minerals. Production mining is the process of excavating the targeted ore after removing the unwanted materials.
