##  Chapter 2 Rotary Kiln Production of ESCS Lightweight Aggregate
Although the first systematic investigation into the production of ESCS lightweight aggregates was undertaken in 1908, it was not until ten years later that the product found commercial application. The process of manufacturing an ESCS aggregate in a rotary kiln was patented by Stephen J. Hayde, a Kansas City

## Production — Stalite
This discussion describes one specific lightweight aggregate manufacturing plant. Other rotary kiln process facilities are similar, but may have variations from the process described herein. The rotary kiln is a long tube that rotates on large bearings. The kiln is lined with insulation and refractory materials.

## Manufacturing Process Of Light Weigth Aggregates
Lightweight Aggregate Production Process. Production Process. Arcosa Lightweight begins with a raw material of select shale or clay, which is quarried at or near the company's manufacturing facilities. The raw material is processed by heating in rotary kilns at temperatures in excess of 2000° F under carefully controlled conditions.

Expanded slag is one of the most important types of light weight aggregates. The blast furnance slag is a by-product of the manufacture of pig iron. The expanded or foamed slag is produced by rapidly quen­ching blast furnance slag. The quenching of slag can be done by the following two methods: (a) Water jet process. (b) Machine process.

##  11.20 Lightweight Aggregate Manufacturing - US EPA
Most lightweight aggregate is produced from materials such as clay, shale, or slate. Blast furnace slag, natural pumice, vermiculite, and perlite can be used as substitutes, however. To produce lightweight aggregate, the raw material (excluding pumice) is expanded to about twice the original volume of the raw material. The expanded material has properties similar to natural aggregate, but is less dense and therefore yields a lighter concrete product.

Lightweight expanded clay aggregate: This is produced by heating clay to a temperature of 1000 - 1200 o C, which causes it to expand due to the internal generation of gases that are trapped inside. The porous structure which forms is retained on cooling so that the specific gravity is much lower than what was before heating it. Advertisements
