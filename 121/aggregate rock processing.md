Aggregate. Sand, gravel and crushed stone are all considered to be aggregates. More simply, aggregates include grains or fragments of rock. They are a non-renewable resource which we benefit from daily, but rarely think about. The aggregate industry is Ontario's largest natural resource industry, affecting almost every aspect of our daily lives.

## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.

## Mineral Processing Wastes - Material Description - User Guidelines for 
Waste rock can be processed to a desired gradation by crushing and sizing, like any other source of aggregate. The hardness of the waste rock is determined by the rock type. For example, iron ores are often found in hard igneous or metamorphic rock formations, so waste rock from iron or taconite ore processing is usually hard and dense.
