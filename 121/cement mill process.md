## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln, which transforms it into clinker, which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement, and has a large effect upon the

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
