## Function block diagrams | Control Engineering
An FBD is a program constructed by connecting multiple functions and function blocks resulting in one block that becomes the input for the next. Unlike textual programming, no variables are necessary to pass data from one subroutine to another because the wires connecting different blocks automatically encapsulate and transfer data.

Our impure function receives that value and re-assigns the counter with the value increased by 1. Observation: mutability is discouraged in functional programming.

Dec 20, 2021FBD (fluidized Bed dryer) works on the fluidization principle. A high-pressure Hot air from the supply is passed through the perforated container containing a wet mass of the granules, after some time granules, particles started to suspend in the air to become dry (called (fluidized state), the process is called fluidization.

## Principle, Construction, Working, Uses, Merits and Demerits of 
Principle The bottom of the fluidized-bed dryer is perforated, where hot air moves through the granules to be dried. The granules rise from the bottom of the air stream as they are suspended in it. The process is known as fluidization. To dry each granule completely, hot air surrounds it. This results in uniform drying of the materials
