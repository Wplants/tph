## Can Quarry Dust Replace Sand in a Cement Mix?
Recent research into the potential of quarry dust in cement mixes have focused upon a partial replacement of the sand. The results to far suggest that a cement mix made of quarry dust has an increased workability, making it more flexible and easy to use, but there are doubts about its durability, and compressive strength. Experiments suggest

Cement can be messy to work with, especially if you're a new do-it-yourselfer. When you realize you've gotten some cement splatter on your newly laid paving stones, don't think you have to live with it. You can clean up the cement while it's still wet or, if it's mostly set, wait to remove it until it's dried.

Cons: Cost & Dust. Cost is a primary consideration when deciding whether to include limestone in your gravel mix, as limestone costs $18 per ton to gravel's $9.50 per ton. Another con: remember the dust we mentioned above? Those fine particles don't pose a problem when the weather is wet, but in the dry summer months, dust can become a real.

## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand?
The cement or mortar is mixed by first adding a portion of the water. The sand and cement are then poured into the water, and the mixture is stirred for several minutes. More water, cement or sand can be added if the mixture is too wet or dry. Below is an example of a sand to cement mix ratio recommendation from a cement manufacturer.
