"Grinding" is what we are all used to: diamond burs grinding off material in planes to make the shape and ending with one sprue. "Milling" is using carbide burs to cut into the block with a punching motion. A large carbide does the majority of the work, and then a finer finishing bur completes the details. There may be multiple sprue connections.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.
