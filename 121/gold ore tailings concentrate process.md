## gold tailings recovery process in singapore
21/12/2016· Its long been known that placer miners are losing almost half of their gold in the traditional recovery process, which relies on mills to separate the gold from the ore and then traps the liberated gold by means of gravity as it is washed down a sluice. But as much as half of the gold ends up in the tailings.

## TREATING CHROME TAILINGS FOR PGMs
The process at Millsell involves six stages, the first of which is the obviously the mining that produces the tailings. The mines, in upgrading the chromite content of their ore, produce a tailings stream that contains the majority of the PGMs of the ROM chrome ores. It is these chrome ores with elevated levels of PGMs that are treated.

Nov 9, 2012. Messages. 2. Nov 9, 2012. #1. I am trying to get some information/advice in regard to a tailing processing project. The current issue is the the concentrate that is produced from the tailing is at 20g/ton. They need it to be at 30g/ton in order to have a buyer. They say they are capturing the gold at 200 mesh, but losing at 100 mesh.
