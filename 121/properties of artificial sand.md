## M Sand Vs River Sand | Difference Between M Sand And River Sand
The physical and mineralogical properties of artificial sand are different from natural sand. Due to the increasing scarcity of natural sand, earth scientists are now recommending using artificial sand for construction. The strength and chemical characteristics of artificial sand or M-sand are somewhat similar when compared with natural sand.
