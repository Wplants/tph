## Project Report on BALL BEARING MANUFACTURING - Manufacturing Process 
Bearings are machine elements which are used to support a rotating member viz., a shaft. They transmit the load from a rotating member to a stationary member known as frame or housing. They permit relative motion of two members in one or two directions with minimum friction, and also prevent the motion in the direction of the applied load.

The ball bearings provide a point contact, and so the friction is less. Ball bearing can be run at high speed but can carry less load. Ball bearings are further divided into three categories suitable for the type of load and applications: deep groove ball bearing, self aligning bearing and angular contact ball bearing. 17.3.2.

A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element bearing that uses balls to maintain the separation between the bearing races. The purpose of a ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. Ball bearings are rolling element bearings that use balls to separate the bearing races and provide smooth, low friction

An automobile ball joint is a pivoting element used to allow rotational motion between the parts of the steering and suspension systems. Depending on the car development, in general, most automobile ball joints are made of a socket, bearing, plug, and ball stud. The manufacturing process assembling these parts is called the caulking process.

## Bearing Balls, Not Ball Bearings | | Industrial Heating
Ball bearings are designed with the assumption that all of the balls in the bearing are carrying an equal load, which means they must be the same size. If, for example, one or two balls were slightly larger, the load would be carried only by the larger balls, and the others would be free spinning. This would result in premature bearing failure.

## Ball Bearing Manufacturing Process - cuisinian
Aug 9, 2021The manufacture of bearing balls depends on the type of material the balls are being made from. Size refers to the farthest possible distance between two points on the ball's surface, as measured by two parallel plates in contact with the surface. The starting size is the nominal ball diameter, which is the nominal, or theoretical, ball
