## Pneumatics vs Hydraulics | What is the difference - Nex Flow Air 
In general, it is a good rule of thumb to use hydraulic systems primarily for heavy lifting applications such as the jaws of life, elevators, hydraulic presses and arms in heavy equipment, and wing flaps for airplanes because these types of systems operate at higher pressures (1 500 to 2 500 psi), generating higher force from small-scale actuators.

Cavitation - Water can cause vapor pockets to form within the fluid, reducing fluid effectiveness and life. Foaming - An excess amount of foaming can result in a slow-responding hydraulic system, as well as cavitation. Premature additive depletion or precipitation can reduce the effectiveness of the fluid's performance.
