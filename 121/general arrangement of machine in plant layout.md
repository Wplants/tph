In general, the collection of liquids should be avoided, and proper drainage is needed for platforms/walkways. Head clearance is an important requirement. Normally vertical clearance above platforms and walkways should be 2.2 m (or more). Wide platforms and walkways are always preferred and narrow ones are not popular.
