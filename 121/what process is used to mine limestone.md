## Common Uses For Limestone | What Can Lime Be Used For?
Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.
