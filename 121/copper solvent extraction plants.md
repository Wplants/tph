The Solvent Extraction step increases copper concentration from 1.5 grams of copper per liter in the PLS to 34 grams per liter in strong electrolyte. The rich electrolyte is then pumped to the Electro-winning Plant where copper is electroplated from solution to form 99.99% pure copper cathode as the final product.

The first large-scale copper SX plant in the world was commissioned at the Nchanga Tailings Leach Plant (TLP) in Zambia in 1974, with a daily production of 200 t Cu cathode (Holmes et al., 1976). The mixer-settlers, configured as four trains each comprising three extraction and two stripping (3E-2S) stages, are long and narrow (aspect ratio

## Solvent extraction and electrowinning
Solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) is a two-stage hydrometallurgical process that first extracts and upgrades copper ions from low-grade leach solutions into a solvent containing a chemical that selectively reacts with and binds the copper in the solvent. The copper is extracted from the solvent with strong aqueous acid which then deposits pure copper onto cathodes using an

In copper solvent extraction, aqueous-in-organic entrainment results in the carry-over of unwanted species into the electrowinning process with negative cost implications. The need to bleed is increased and the purity of the copper cathode is potentially compromised, depending on the impurities being transferred (Cl, NO3, Fe, Mn). In some cases

Compared with cementation, solvent extraction has considerable advantages. First of all, typical operating costs for a combined solvent extraction electrowinning operation can be as low as $30/ton of copper for the larger capacity plants. For cement copper, freight and smelting charges alone usually exceed this figure.

Solvent extraction has been routinely used for copper refining since its invention in the 1960s, and it is suggested that well over 10% of refined copper production from ores is obtained by solvent extraction, accounting for millions of tonnes of metal. It is even more popular for refining copper from scrap.
