Dec 01, 2020· Very good properties of concrete with basalt aggregate, in addition to the best crushing strength of this aggregate, may also result from the micro-roughness and angularity of basalt grains. In turn, granite contains large quartz crystals with a smooth, shell-like breakthrough, which can significantly reduce the strength of concrete.

Basalt Rock Properties and Uses - Science Struck. The rock hardness of basalt is 6 on the Mohs scale, and can be seen through a combination of its compressive strength: Mpa (Megapascal), its tensile strength: 10-30 Mpa, and its shear strength: 20-60 Mpa, which denotes that depending on the mineral makeup, basalt rocks fall in the strong - very strong category.

The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## Experimental Study on the Mechanical Properties and Compression Size 
After shear cracking, aggregate interlock is one of the principal mechanisms of shear transfer across cracks. In this case, volume and characteristics of coarse aggregates and the strength of the mortar in concrete are likely to have a significant influence on the aggregate interlock . The research results on the shear behavior of RAC are not
