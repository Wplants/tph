Antimony ore can be divided into antimonite, cubismite, antimony ochre, etc. Due to the difference in the nature of the ore, the process used is also different. Commonly used beneficiation processes include manual separation, gravity separation and flotation . This article briefly introduces these three commonly used antimony ore beneficiation

Based on a long-term antimony price of $8,500 a ton, the company estimates that the net present value of the project is around $279m. Future outlook. Although mining antimony is cheaper in China because of labour costs and the typically large deposits, the trend in declining production is set to endure.

## Antimony Recovery from End-of-Life Products and Industrial Process 
Antimony has become an increasingly critical element in recent years, due to a surge in industrial demand and the Chinese domination of primary production. Antimony is produced from stibnite ore (Sb2O3) which is processed into antimony metal and antimony oxide (Sb2O3). The industrial importance of antimony is mainly derived from its use as flame retardant in plastics, coatings, and electronics
