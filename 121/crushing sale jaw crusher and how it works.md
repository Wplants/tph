## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
The main function of a jaw crusher is to reduce large-sized ore or rocks with the use of compression. The fixed jaw, which is typically positioned in a "V" alignment is a stationary "breaking surface". The jaw that moves exerts force or pressure onto the rocks by forcing these materials against a stationary plate.

Jaw Crushers are most often used as the first stage in the size reduction of many different types of materials in a wide range of applications. They use compressive force to break material between a stationary piece of steel (called a jaw die) and a moving piece of steel that together create a V-shaped cavity called the crushing chamber.
