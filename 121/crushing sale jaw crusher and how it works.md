The main function of a jaw crusher is to reduce large-sized ore or rocks with the use of compression. The fixed jaw, which is typically positioned in a "V" alignment is a stationary "breaking surface". The jaw that moves exerts force or pressure onto the rocks by forcing these materials against a stationary plate.
