##  Metallurgical Coal
Coal is the world's most plentiful fossil fuel and by far Canada's most abundant fossil fuel, with over 6.6 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Canada has both Metallurgical coal (anthracite and bituminous) and Thermal coal (sub-bituminous and lignite) deposits. Bituminous Sub-Bituminous Lignite egetation Peat ime Heat and Pressure

## Canada's only underground coal mine is back in business — and emissions 
The Donkin mine was closed between 2017 and 2020 when more than a dozen roof cave-ins prompted a series of on-and-off stop-work orders from the province. Now, as the price of metallurgical coal has spiked, the mine is back in action. Canada has passed legislation to phase out coal-fired electricity by 2030.

## Coal in Canada
In Western Canada, coal was first mined on Vancouver Island in the mid-19th century. The development of the Canadian Pacific railway led to mines being built in towns along its route in Alberta. By 1911, Western Canada was producing most of the country's coal, and Alberta was the country's largest producing province.

## A hard look at coal mining across Canada
The majority of mining and power generation operators are engaged in long-term contracts. Sherritt, the largest thermal coal producer in Canada, reported an average realized price of $17.48/t in 2012. However, NRCan says this price is merely a reflection of the cost of mining coal and cannot be regarded as the prevailing market price.
