A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

## Aggregates
Aggregates refer to hard, granular materials such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone that are used for construction purposes. Anything made from concrete or asphalt requires aggregates. In Ontario today, almost every building, road, and structure contains some form of aggregate. Each year, the industry uses about 14 tonnes of aggregate for every person in Ontario.
