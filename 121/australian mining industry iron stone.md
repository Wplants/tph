## Ironstone miners - Tees Valley Museums
As the ironstone mining industry developed, ironmasters built ironworks and blast furnaces to smelt the ironstone into iron, and later steel. New railway lines were built to transport the ironstone from the mines to the ironworks, and on to the docks for export around the world. These railways soon became passenger lines as well as freight lines.
