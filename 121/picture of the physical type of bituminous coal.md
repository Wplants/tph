The best variety of coal is Anthracite It is also known as the hard coal and attained its name due to the compact carbon variety with a submetallic luster. It contains the greatest carbon content, minimal impurities, and massive energy density of all coal types, and is the top coals ranking. Moreover, anthracite is also the oldest variety of

Coals are classified into three main ranks, or types: lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite. These classifications are based on the amount of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen present in the coal. Coals other constituents include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, ash, and sulfur. Some of the undesirable chemical constituents include chlorine and sodium.

Characteristics of Bituminous Coal. Bituminous coal contains moisture of up to approximately 17%. About 0.5 to 2 percent of the weight of bituminous coal is nitrogen. Its fixed carbon content ranges up to approximately 85 percent, with ash content up to 12% by weight. Bituminous coal can be categorized further by the level of volatile matter

## Bituminous Coal - Density - Strength - Material Properties
Bituminous Coal - Thermal Conductivity. Thermal conductivity of Bituminous Coal is 0.2 W/ (m·K). The heat transfer characteristics of a solid material are measured by a property called the thermal conductivity, k (or λ), measured in W/m.K. It is a measure of a substance's ability to transfer heat through a material by conduction.

Bituminous: Bituminous coal is a middle rank coal between subbituminous and anthracite. Bituminous usually has a high heating (Btu) value and is the most common type of coal used in electricity generation in the United States. Bituminous coal appears shiny and smooth when you first see it, but look closer and you may see it has layers.

Bituminous coals are subdivided into coking and non-coking coals and each one of them in turn is divided into gas coal and steam coal. Coking coal is used for coke-making domestic fuel, the soft coke. It contains a higher percentage of carbon (70-75%) and less water and oxygen than lignite.

Bituminous coals are black, shiny, and generally hard.They are a medium-rank coal. Bituminous coals generally have calorific values above 11,500 Btu/lb and volatile matter below 14% (ASTM, Jackson, 1997). In the Illinois Basin (and western Kentucky), however, the lower rank end of what are termed bituminous coals in the United States have calorific values of 11,100 to 11,300 Btu/lb.

Scientists estimate that approximately 20 feet of decompressed plant matter may have been needed to form one foot of bituminous coal. Bituminous coals or soft coals are the largest group of coals. It is the most widely used type of coal in the world. It has been named so due to the presence of a gluey and tar-like substance known as bitumen in it.

Bituminous, or soft coal, is the most common coal. It is dense and black, with a moisture content of less than 20% and an ignition range of 700 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Bituminous coal is used to generate electricity, for space heating, and to produce coke. Bituminous coal contains a heating value range of 19 to 30 million Btu per ton.

Bituminous is it the most abundant and most-used type of coal. This type of coal contains between 50% - 80% carbon, 20%-40% volatile matter. It has high calorific value and therefore, mainly used for thermal power stations and chemical industries. It is also used to produce coking coal used in blast furnaces. Energy ranges from 25-35MJ/kg.

As for bituminous coal liquefaction technology, the R&D program of the NEDOL process started in 1984. Fig. 4.69 shows a flow diagram of the NEDOL process (Wasaka, 1999b; Wasaka et al., 2003). The NEDOL process liquefies coal by using a Fe-based catalyst and hydrotreated solvent under relatively mild reaction conditions of °C and hydrogen pressure of 15-20 MPa.

## Coal explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Bituminous coal is the most abundant rank of coal found in the United States, and it accounted for about 44% of total U.S. coal production in 2020. Bituminous coal is used to generate electricity and is an important fuel and raw material for making coking coal or use in the iron and steel industry. Bituminous coal was produced in at least 18

## Bituminous Coal | Properties, Price & Application | Material Properties
Coal is a rock formed from the decomposition of plant life. It is primarily composed of carbon, with many other trace elements. Bituminous coal or black coal is a relatively soft coal containing a tarlike substance called bitumen or asphalt. It is of higher quality than lignite and Sub-bituminous coal, but of poorer quality than anthracite.
