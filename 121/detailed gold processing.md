## Everything about Gold Processing - Refine Max Inc
Gold processing is about preparing the gold ore for using it in different products. The vital gold ores come with gold in the Indigenous form. It is available in both endogenetic as well as exogenetic forms. Gold in the endogenetic form comes from the underground. On the other hand, the exogenetic form is available at the earth's surface.

Put a drop of gold detection liquid on the wet spot on the paper towel. If any gold is still dissolved in the acid, the wet spot will turn a purple-black or a purple-brown. If you see this color change then give the precipitant more time to work and/or add more precipitant, and repeat the test until you determine that no gold is dissolved in acid.

Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

Gold filled metal is created by applying a thick sheet or layer of gold over a base metal core, which is then rolled under heat and high pressure until permanently bonded to the base metal. The base metal used is often brass or copper. The gold purity must be of at least 10K gold, and 12K, 14K or 18K gold can also be used in this process.
