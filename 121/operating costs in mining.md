## Mining operating costs of open-pit and underground.
As it is clear in Fig. 2, in relation to an open-pit mine including 130 Mt of ore, mining operating cost is US$2.28 per each tonnage of produced ore. This operating cost is considered only during

## Mine operating costs and the potential impacts of energy and grinding
The raw operating costs for each category (Mining, Milling, G & A) were summed and converted to percentages of the total. The resulting percentages were defined as relative costs. The relative costs were analysed on the basis of their distribution; mean and median values, range, and the 95% confidence interval of the mean.

## Mining Costs - CAPEX vs. OPEX
The mining costs are estimated in a mining company's feasibility study which, when available, can be found on the company's website (often hidden between the news releases).  The operational expenditures are those recurring costs for operating the mine. In short, OPEX are those direct and indirect costs to mine, process and sell the ore.

According to a report, mining one Bitcoin takes up to 1,544 kWh to complete. Putting this into perspective, that is the equivalent of powering an average household for 53 days. What is more interesting is that the average cost is $0.068 per kWh. This roughly places the cost to approximately $104 in energy bills.

Energy costs typically comprise one of the largest ongoing costs of mining operations, of which 70% is devoted to the comminution of the ore (Norgate and Jahanshahi, 2010). Furthermore, the most significant energy cost occurs in the grinding circuit of the Milling section, where up to 97% of the energy cost is incurred (Ballantyne et al., 2012).
