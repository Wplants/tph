In the 1640's, Sweden's exports of bar iron amounted to around 11,000 tonnes a year. Fifty years later, the average was about 27,000 tonnes a year and in the 1740's an average of 40,000 tonnes a year was achieved. The large increase depended almost wholly on the emergence of new markets, firstly in Holland and then in England.
