## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions, and the strength of the aggregate used in road construction is expressed by numerical index. Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower

## Crushing Strength Of All Grades Of Concrete
Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures. Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc.

## Everything You Need to Know About Concrete Strength | Cor-Tuf
While traditional concrete normally has a compressive strength ranging anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 psi, UHPC can have a compressive strength of up to 10 times that of traditional concrete. After just 14 days of curing, UHPC has a compressive strength of 20,000 psi. This number increases to 30,000 psi when fully cured for 28 days.

How strong is concrete with rebar? This composite material is extremely strong.
