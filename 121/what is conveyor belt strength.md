## conveyor belt strength
Dec 24, 2019· Conveyor belt is an important element of the conveyor. The strength of the steel cord conveyor belt largely determines the carrying capacity, and it also has a great impact on operational safety. In this paper, the effect of different factors on the strength of the steel cord conveyor belt splices was studied.

## Conveyor belt
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt

Conveyor belts take a significant amount of punishment throughout their lifespans. A splice is invaluable when it returns a damaged belt to its former strength. Other splicing methods, including cold vulcanizing and mechanical splicing, can manage a repair and are often faster than hot vulcanization.
