The Stag jaw crusher has a fixed jaw and a moving jaw pivoted at the top Crushing faces are formed of manganese steel. The max movement of the jaw is at the bottom; so there is little tendency for the machine to clog, though some uncrushed material may fall through and have to be returned to the crusher.

## Selecting the right crusher : Pit & Quarry
A jaw crusher is a compression type of crusher. Material is reduced by squeezing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The discharge size is controlled by the setting or the space between those two pieces of steel. The tighter the setting, the smaller the output size and the lower the throughput capacity.

Types of crushers Most crushers used for aggregate production can be categorised as one of three main types: Compression crushers - which squeeze the material until it breaks. Impact crushers - which use the principle of rapid impact to shatter material. A ttrition crushers - which use both impact and grinding to shear material.

## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

A jaw crusher is a compression type of crusher. Feed material is reduced by squeezing it between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel, with the discharge size controlled by the gap setting, ie the space between those two pieces of steel. The tighter the setting, the smaller the output size and the lower the throughput capacity.
