What are the reclamation standards for limestone, shell and dolomite mines? The Florida Legislature requires reclamation of lands disturbed by the mining of limestone, shell and dolomite. For mines that began after Oct. 1, 1986, all areas disturbed by mining must be reclaimed. "Existing mines" are mines where mining began on before Oct. 1, 1986.

Dolomite as a ceramic material is a uniform calcium magnesium carbonate. In ceramic glazes, it is used as a source of magnesia and calcia. Other than talc, dolomite is the principal source of MgO in high-temperature raw glazes. 'Dolomite matte' stoneware glazes, for example, are highly prized for their pleasant 'silky' surface texture.

Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.
