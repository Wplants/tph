## Pakistan's ending Coal Imports to hit South African coal's prospects: IEEFA
Reported in two of Pakistan's major newspapers, the government is planning a range of reforms to address the hopelessly unsustainable financial position the nation's power sector is in. These include the cessation of further coal-fired power development and the conversion of existing plants using imported coal (around 5,500 megawatts) to use domestic coal instead.

Its use was also found in historic steam engines at the dawn of the industrial revolution. However, environmental considerations have challenged the use of coal as a fuel in the 21st century. But solutions exist whereby coal can be used in a way that it causes less environmental harm. Modern technology is there to help.

If Thar coal substitution saves $175 per ton, the annual cost saving per plant would be $875 million. If one assumes the project's additional capex for conversion to the tune of $250 million, the payback period would be 3.42 months.

## Question: Do all power plants use coal? - Origin of coal
The major disadvantage of coal is its negative impact on the environment. Coal-burning energy plants are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to carbon monoxide and heavy metals like mercury, the use of coal releases sulfur dioxide, a harmful substance linked to acid rain.
