Find a Suitable Place: Find a wide open space, even better if it is shaded, that will work if rain is not that much in your place.The space should be wide enough to mix concrete and to pour it in mold. Make the mold: Use plywood planks and nails to make a one side open box with an inner cavity of 300mm (length) x 200mm (width) x 150mm (thick). This is the standard size of a concrete brick.
