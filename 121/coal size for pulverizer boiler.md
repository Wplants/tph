## Reliable Coal Pulverizers and Mills » Babcock & Wilcox
Pulverizers / Mills. Reliable coal pulverizer performance is essential for sustained full-load operation of today's power plants. An effective pulverizer must be capable of handling a wide variety of coals and accommodating load swings in utility boilers as large as 1,300 MW. B&W's pulverizers, found at power stations throughout the world.
