## Concrete Mixer: What do these machines do, their types and applications 
Concrete -- a mixture of aggregates (fine or coarse), cement and water -- is an essential building material widely used in modern-day construction because of its strength, durability and versatility. Depending on the ratio of its constituent ingredients, concrete can be produced in a wide range of compressive strength or grades.

Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.
