## The Process of Metal Extraction from Ore - Term Paper
Metals with quite a low reactivity can be extracted by roasting the ore in air. The oxygen in the air reacts with the compound, releasing the metal. Copper and mercury ores can be treated in this way to extract the metal. Carbon reduction Metals with a medium reactivity can be extracted using a process called carbon reduction.

gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

The most important factors that determine ore deposition are the temperature and pressure of the fluid. If they drop, the solubility of the metals decreases. Moreover, the two factors also influence how brittle the rock is, which in turn governs the formation of veins and its permeability. Strong excess fluid pressures are required for vein

The frothed ore collects on the oil section whereas the impurities settle down in the water medium. Chemical Separation: One way of concentrating the ore is by chemical separation. For example, the separation of aluminium (Al) from the bauxite ore. This process of separating aluminium from the bauxite ore is also termed Bayer's Process.

[1.7.10] What are the best ways to process ores  Just wanna mention, there IS a way you can get more than 2x ores out of most "smeltable" ores (gold, iron, copper, etc.). If you make a Tinkers' Construct Hammer/Pickaxe with both fortune and autosmelt, you get fortune on the dropped ores. This equates to 1-4 ingots per ore, which averages to 2.5.

## Process for treating sulfide-bearing ores - University of Utah
A process for removing sulfur from a sulfide-bearing ore comprising the steps of: mixing lime with the sulfide-bearing ore; adding water to said mixture; heating the mixture such that water vapor reacts with the sulfide-bearing ore to form hydrogen sulfide gas, thereby substantially removing the sulfur from said ore; and.

## rare-earth element - Processing ores | Britannica
Processing ores All rare-earth ores contain less than 10 percent REO and must be upgraded to about 60 percent in order to be processed further. They are first ground to a powder and then separated from the other materials in the ore body by various standard processes that include magnetic and/or electrostatic separation and flotation.
