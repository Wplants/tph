In construction terms, the volume of ready mix that these concrete trucks can carry is measured in a cubic yard. In most cases, they can handle a total of 10 yd.³. If you decide to get a short load, which is a smaller load, it can go all the way down to one. However, the cost of delivery is still going to be about the same.

## Understanding Concrete Pump Capacity Per Hour | Big D Ready Mix
The 39M Concrete Pump will pour up to 180 cubic yards of concrete per hour. The concrete will be mixed all throughout its use, allowing for a smooth, efficient build. This is worth noting as the longer the reach of a pump, the longer the concrete will have to travel to reach its destination. Any stagnant time span will cause the concrete to harden.

## How much concrete does a concrete truck hold?
Sep 10, 2021A standard sized concrete truck will hold around 9-Yards of concrete. This is sufficient to provide concrete for a slab of concrete that is 8 ft. x 10 ft. and 4-inches thick. This figure can vary by yard either way. There are some trucks that will only carry 8 yards, and there are some trucks that carry 10 yards.
