## Uranium mining
Uranium mining is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. The worldwide production of uranium in 2019 amounted to 53,656 tonnes. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia were the top three uranium producers, respectively, and together account for 68% of world production. Other countries producing more than 1,000 tonnes per year included Namibia, Niger, Russia, Uzbekistan, the United

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.

## Effects of Mineral Revolution in South Africa - Kitabuni
Environmental Effects of Mineral Revolution. Loss of biodiversity. Mining activities destroyed landscapes and forests leading to loss of wildlife. Water pollution by mining also killed aquatic organisms e.g. disappearance of waterweeds at Kimberley since 1860s was due to pollution by chemicals from mining ( Makhosezwe: 1990).

## South Africa's mining industry weathered COVID-19
Oct 6, 2020Gold mining companies had an increase of 35% in revenue. Revenue for the 'other mining' segments increased by 7%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident from April 2020, with reductions in revenue being seen across the industry. South African PGMs and gold are mainly mined in deep-level underground mines and were therefore hardest hit.
