The design strength is the required strength of concrete to be designed as per the IS code. For example, assume that the strength of concrete required M25, and the target design strength is 28.5 N/Sqmm. Now the chances of failure of concrete cubes fail at 25N/Sqmm is only 5%. The design strength is 28.5 N/Sqmm, and the characteristic strength

## Compressive Strength Of Concrete | What you need to know
The compressive strength of concrete is defined as the resistance to failure under the decided force. It is the maximum load applied at any cross-sectional area. You can calculate the compressive strength of concrete by the formula, F = P / A. Where, F is the compressive strength. P is the maximum load applied in Newton.

The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
