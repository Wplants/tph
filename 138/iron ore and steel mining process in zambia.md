Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon and other elements. According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent).

## Making steel | ArcelorMittal
Making steel. Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route. Both processes are being continually improved

Australia has long been China's go-to for iron ore, with Australia's vast iron ore production and the proximity of the two countries making for a productive relationship. Australia is the largest source of feed for China's steel mills, with around 60% of China's iron ore imports originating from Australian mines.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.
