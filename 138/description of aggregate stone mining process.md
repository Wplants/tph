## Granite - Mining, processing, products & markets - Primary Info
Granite is nearly always massive, hard and tough, and it is for this reason it has gained widespread use as a construction stone. The average density of granite is 2.75 g·cm-3 with a range of 1.74 g·cm-3 to 2.80 g·cm-3.

## Environmental Impacts Of Mining Natural Aggregate | SpringerLink
The most obvious environmental impact of aggregate mining is the conversion of land use, most likely from undeveloped or agricultural land use, to a (temporary) hole in the ground. This major impact is accompanied by loss of habitat, noise, dust, blasting effects, erosion, sedimentation, and changes to the visual scene.
