The type of mining activity needed to exploit a particular resource depends on a few key factors. Firstly, the type of mineral excavated plays a key role in mine planning. Secondly, the location and position of the deposit must be carefully considered. Finally, the available volume of minerals influences the type of mine to be used.

## What Are The Four Characteristics Of A Mineral - Realonomics
A formal definition of a mineral as used by geologists would be: A naturally occurring inorganic solid that has a definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure. Geologists are able to identify minerals because they have characteristic physical properties. What are the characteristics of mineral resources?

## If A Mineral Can Be Mined What Is It Called - Realonomics
What is a mineral that can be mined called? A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.26 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum. What are the four types of mineral mining?

## Ocean scientists measure sediment plume stirred up by deep-sea-mining 
MIT scientists measured a sediment plume stirred up by a protoype of a deep-sea-mining vehicle to help gauge the impact of such vehicles if they are used to mine minerals like nickel and cobalt. The vehicle created a dense sediment plume that remained relatively low, staying within 2 meters of the seafloor.

The type of mining method used depends on a number of factors such as the type of mineral resource, the location of the minerals, and whether or not it's justifiable to extract the mineral with expensive mining costs. Each mining method has its own advantages and varying levels of environmental impact, all of which are heavily considered

## Why Are Minerals Important To The Rock Cycle - Realonomics
Rocks are made of minerals. Rocks are named for the combinations of minerals they are made of and the ways those minerals came together. Remember that different minerals form under different environmental conditions. So the minerals in a rock contain clues about the conditions in which the rock formed.

There are two main stages in this type of mining, which are development mining and production mining. Development mining is the initial phase of removing the non-valuable components such as rock to access the targeted minerals.
