## The use of additives in the brick making process
In shaping, the additive promotes better flow of the mix particles when a force is applied, and it reduces friction between the clay mix and the applied force (press, extruder, etc.). This lower friction promotes a reduction of added water, electrical energy inputs, heat generation and external lubrication.

Clay Brick Making: Learn the Process DoItYourself. The soil you plan to use to make your bricks will need to be tested for content. You should not attempt to make bricks from soil that has a greater sand or silt content than content of clay. The suggested proportion should be 30% sand, 70% clay. But you can get by with a 50% proportion.
