Assumption on Beneficiation test of gold ore. Beneficiation, Laboratory and Pilot. According to the requirements of the mine owner, the six samples were combined into three kinds of raw ore samples in pairs. Then the three kinds of raw ore were crushed to -2mm and mixed, then the samples were taken out for testing sample and stored separately.

## Guides For High-sulfide Gold Processing
High sulfide gold ore refers to 20% -30% of gold wrapped by sulfide (mainly pyrite). It is better to use gravity separation, flotation, or flotation-cyanidation process. The following is an analysis of specific beneficiation tests, and introduces four commonly used gold processing methods for high-sulfide gold ores.
