## Can You Put Gravel Over Concrete? - Home Inspection Insider
Sep 24, 2021You can create concrete by mixing cement with aggregate. Aggregate is a filer and bulking agent comprised of sand, gravel, stone, etc., making up 60-80% of the mix. When combined with water, it gives concrete its strength. Choosing the right kind of aggregate will ensure your finished product will last for many years.

3. Crushed Stone. Crushed stone is closely related to decomposed granite (DG), but these rocks are not crushed as finely as DG. Both are popular for contemporary landscapes, but crushed stone offers a crisper look than DG. Pros: Crushed stone can be poured and compacted in any shape, providing design flexibility.
