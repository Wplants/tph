## Solar thermal power plants - Energy Information Administration
Parabolic trough linear concentrating systems are used in one of the longest operating solar thermal power facilities in the world, the Solar Energy Generating System (SEGS) located in the Mojave Desert in California. The facility has had nine separate plants over time, with the first plant in the system, SEGS I, operating from 1984 to 2015

## What are Coal feeders? Principle, components. | Instrumentation and 
What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).. The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume fraction.
