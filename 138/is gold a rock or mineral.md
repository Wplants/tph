Since gold depositing in quartz rocks is a natural process, one cannot ascertain or say with certainty the amount of gold one could find in the rock. However, it's worth mentioning that a quartz rock weighing 95kg (209.5lb), located in Western Australia in 2018, had approximately 70 kg (154 lb) of gold deposits.

## What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition, crystal form, and physical properties. Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals, or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter.
