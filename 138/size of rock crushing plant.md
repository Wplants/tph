Here, "grains" refers to the unit of weight; 7,000 grains equals one pound. At the temperatures and moisture contents normally seen, ACFM is nearly equal to SCFM. For a hypothetical plant with a baghouse and stack flow of 4,000 SCFM, the emission rate would be 4,000 SCFM  0.022 gr/DSCF  60 min/hr / 7,000 gr/lb = 0.75 lb/hr.

##  Environmental GUIDELINE ON STONE CRUSHING plant
A stone crushing plant is primarily involved in the manufacture of aggregates of various sizes (coarse aggregates, crusher run, rock sand and other fine aggregates) from basalt boulders. Coarse aggregates are usually used in ready mix concrete and asphaltic concrete. Crusher run is used for the bases and sub-bases for road making.

## size of rock crushing plant
The physical size and power requirements of a crusher capable of reducing hard rock vary depending on the application. Extended experience in most crushing plants show that a minus 19MM (¾") rod mill feed can be and is being produced in three stages of crushing.
