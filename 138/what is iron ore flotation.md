In 1976, Amoco discovered it was economically feasible to extract iodine from brine water in its deep Oklahoma wells. By 2004, iodine was bringing $14 a kilogram on the open market. Rising demand and a decline in Japanese production has caused iodine to rise to $45 a kilogram by 2013. At one point last year, iodine spiked at $92 a kilogram. "/>.

## WOA1 - Mineral ore flotation using carboxymethyl  - Google
A flotation method for mineral processing is disclosed. The method for floating comprises a first step comprises using a first carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in a first flotation cell, and a subsequent step comprises using a second CMC in a subsequent flotation cell, the first and second CMCs having different characteristics. The first CMC has a degree of substitution (DS) that is different
