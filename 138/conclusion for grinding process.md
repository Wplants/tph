STEP 1. The plastic material to be ground enters a granulator via a specific loading system. When it reaches the cutting chamber, it is shredded by a rotating body (rotor), to which blades are applied. Fixed blades (or counter blades), positioned in the cutting chamber in a diametrically opposite position, are used for cutting.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.
