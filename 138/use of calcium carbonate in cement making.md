## A New Concept of Calcium Carbonate Concrete using Demolished Concrete 
In the proposed concept, calcium carbonate comprising Ca originating from demolished concrete or other Ca-containing industrial wastes and HCO 3-from CO 2 gas collected from the air or emitted by industrial plants acts as a binder for aggregates, which can be natural rocks or crushed demolished concrete. This short paper describes the details

## Portland Cement Uses | How to Use Portland Cement | What Is Portland 
There is a simple process and need some material to make Portland cement. The materials that are needed for this are limestone, silicon, fly ash, iron, and aluminium, etc.; At first raw materials of calcium carbonate, silicon, iron oxide are crushed and mixed, then the crushed raw materials are placed into a rotating cement kiln.; The kiln is horizontally placed whose one side is slightly up

## use of calcium carbonate in cement making
Amazingly Versatile Uses of Calcium Carbonate - Science . Jan 27, 2020· Calcium carbonate can produce from the marble. You can make calcium carbonate from by crossing the CO2 from the calcium hydroxide. We can make this material by the mixing of the baking soda with acid boric. These are the ways that you can make calcium carbonate.
