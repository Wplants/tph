## The Role of Mercury in Gold Refining - Manhattan Gold & Silver
When mercury dissolves another metal, the resulting mixture or alloy is called an amalgam - which is useful for many aspects of precious metal refining. Most pre-19th century placer mining operations relied on mercury to retrieve the maximum amount of gold. By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected.

2. Add nitric acid to the beaker. For every ounce (about 28 g) of scrap gold, you'll need 30 milliliters (1 fl oz) of nitric acid. Add the acid to the beaker and wait at least 30 minutes to allow the reaction to occur. If you can, wait overnight to allow the harmful fumes to burn off.

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The mercury amalgamation gold extraction process has a particularly large enrichment ratio. It can obtain gold amalgam with about 30% grade from raw ore containing 2-3 g/ton of gold, and the gold amalgam can be refined into gold with more than 70% grade in the mine, which greatly reduces the transportation of semi-finished products in mines.

Hi ceewye! Like brother machiavelli stated, gold straight from ore is not pure or 24k. Depends from the area you get the ore. For example, gold from different deposits in Alaska can be up to 22k. In California's Mother Lode around 16k. Around Colorado there're tellurides deposits, gold with high content of silver.
