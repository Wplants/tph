## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

##  Chapter-8 Beneficiation of Iron Ores
C is one for very thin disc, and zero for very long rod. For general ore particles it varies from 0.15 to 0.25 Any change in field intensity causes the change in permeability and hence flux density. If field intensity is increased the flux density also increases. When a particle placed in to a homogeneous magnetic field, the particle is exposed
