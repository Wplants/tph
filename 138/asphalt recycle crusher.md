After milling, the asphalt remnants (millings) are then transported back to C & R Asphalt's recycling facilities to be crushed. Once the crushing cycle is complete, the asphalt is screened to remove any large pieces and is processed to meet asphalt milling standards of 5/8". Millings are ideal for long rural driveways and farms.
