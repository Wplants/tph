Graphite ores are classified as "amorphous" (microcrystalline), and "crystalline" ("flake" or "lump or chip") based on the ore's crystallinity, grain-size, and morphology. All graphite deposits mined today formed from metamorphism of carbonaceous sedimentary rocks, and the ore type is determined by the geologic setting.

We know that graphite is a carbon allotrope and carbon is non-metal. So graphite is non-metal. So, the correct answer is Option D. Note: We must know that a crystalline form of the carbon with the atoms of arrangement of carbons in a hexagonal structure is graphite. The colour of graphite is greyish black and graphite is an opaque substance.

## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

Graphite. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.
