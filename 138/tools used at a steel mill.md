## How to stainless steel milling?
When milling stainless steel, the cutting edge must be sharp and bear the impact, and the chip pocket should be large. Large helical angle milling cutters (cylindrical milling cutters, end mills) can be used. The screw angle b is increased from 20° to 45° (gn=5°), and the tool durability can be increased by more than 2 times.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

There are many factors that go into determining the running parameters for stainless steel machining, but there are some general guidelines to follow as a starting point. Generally speaking, when machining stainless steels a SFM of between is recommended, with a chip load ranging between .0005" for a 1/8" end mill up to .006" for

There are different processes that can be used to produce tool steels, but all of them have something in common. The production of tool steel has to be carried out in environments with controlled conditions to ensure high quality. Regarding the contents, tool steels usually have in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% of carbon.
