Prolonged exposure to lead can cause abdominal pain, constipation, depression, irritability, and nausea. Additionally, emissions from coal plants cause acid rain. This forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides mix with water and other chemicals in the air to make acid that falls to the Earth as rain.

The production cycle of open-cast coal mines generally includes drilling, blasting, loading, hauling and coal preparation activities. Individual optimization of these activities does not mean that the whole system is optimized.

By Russell A. Carter, Managing Editor. The success or failure of an individual blasthole to achieve its intended effect doesn't carry much statistical clout in a blast pattern comprising up to 1,500 holes, or at a mine that routinely conducts multiple daily blasts—or across a global industry that measures total daily blasthole production in the five-figure range or higher.
