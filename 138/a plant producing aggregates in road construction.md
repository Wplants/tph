## Construction Aggregates - Vulcan Materials
Construction Aggregates. Vulcan is North America's leading producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel. We produce these materials from natural deposits such as granite, limestone and trap rock. Our quarrying process typically begins with drilling and blasting the rock into smaller pieces.
