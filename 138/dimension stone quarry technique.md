## Production of Natural Stone | Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse - NGU
Usually, the blasting technique is tailored to the properties of the specific rock type. Today, the most common method to quarry the dimension stone is by cutting out the primary blocks with a wire gang saw. Diamond wire cables are threaded through the drillholes, and tightening the wire during the sawing results soon in large cuts

The freed walls of stone are then cut into rough blocks, and diamond wire saws are used for the final trimming. Overall, the quarry produces 1,000 cubic meters of stone per month. The typical block size is 5 to 6 cubic meters, with measurements around 295 x 190 x 180 cm.

Blasting for Quarrying Stones. This method, explosives are used to exfoliate the stones from parent rock. This process is done in case of a hard stone or hard rock which does not contain any fissures or cracks. The holes are drilled in the rock and explosives are arranged in the deep holes and blasted with proper safety measures.
