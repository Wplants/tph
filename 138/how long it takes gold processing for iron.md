## » Gold Panning Instructions
The gold pan is most commonly used to locate a richer paying area by sampling, so that larger production equipment can be brought into that location to work the ground to recover more gold.. There are stories in the old mining records about the ground being so rich during the 1849 gold rush that as much as 96 ounces of gold were recovered from a single pan.

Completely submerge the gold pan in water. Fill the gold pan approximately 2/3 full with the dirt you collected and want to wash. Don't fill the gold pan all the way up as it can become too heavy and take too long to completely pan. Place the gold pan with dirt completely under the water and mix up the gravel with your fingers.

Gold smelting is a long process and involves a number of steps. Here are the major steps you should follow when smelting gold: 1. Gold Processing .  The iron in the gold ore can be removed by the oxidation of the iron by use of either a forced air oven or nitric acid. The iron oxide may then be removed from the gold materials to be smelted

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

These foods will block your body from extracting iron from iron supplements. You can also take in minimal amounts at least 2 hours after consuming iron supplements to make sure they will work. However, it is better to take it when your stomach is empty because your body will absorb iron better in this condition.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
