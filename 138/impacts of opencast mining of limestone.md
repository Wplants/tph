Minimize ground vibrations caused by open cast mining Open cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow pit. Walls of the pit are generally blast mined, creating ground vibrations and resulting in dust generation and water, air, and noise pollution.
