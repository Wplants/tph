## Should you add sand to garden soil? The pros and cons
Sand can effectively create pockets of air, increasing aeration, drainage and generally loosening up the soil. This is especially helpful for plants with fine wire roots, such as lettuces. Essentially, you want to add sand to garden soil to improve the drainage, make the mixture lighter, or stop the soil from clumping and being too compact.

## Is Beach Sand Good For Plants? (Gardening Experts Comment)
Yes, but usually in moderation. Healthy soil is composed of equal (or near-equal) amounts of sand, silt, and clay. Beach sand is great to use as a soil additive, especially if you're making your own potting mix. Sand alone isn't a great idea because it has too much drainage and will not hold water or nutrients.

## The Slow-Release Benefits of Basalt - Maximum Yield
By mimicking the slow process of the Earth's method for producing healthy soil, crushed volcanic basalt helps support the biological processes required for optimal and sustainable plant growth. Well-suited to the needs of most indoor growers, volcanic basalt produces relatively little ambient dust and is easy to add to most indoor growing mixes.

## Rock Dust - Can It Remineralize the Earth? - Garden Myths
Basalt, an igneous rock wasn't processed or transformed by the environment, so the plant nutrients in it, are just as they were when they came out of the center of the Earth This marketing person seems to be unaware of the fact that the minerals in rocks can't be used by plants until the environment, or life forms convert them into usable
