## Surface mining - strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

In addition to being safe and efficient, precision surface mining methods are helping miners create better sustainability practices. The vibrations caused by blasting can damage nearby infrastructure, including roads, utility lines, pipelines and buildings. To avoid this, mines are forced to abandon areas within close proximity to these obstacles.
