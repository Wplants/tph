Coal Mining. Print. Coal is a solid that, if we are to use it, must be extracted from the earth. This is coal mining, going into the earth to remove coal for our consumption. The basic steps of mining and processing coal are described below. There are two general methods of coal mining: surface mining and underground mining.

Extracting coal from underground or open-pit mines continues to be a vital part of the world economy today. Depending on the depth of the deposit, coal is extracted from underground or open-pit mines. In underground mines, vertical shafts are sunk and then galleries excavated horizontally. In open-pit mines, benches are drilled to allow trucks

Processing the Coal Source: bloomberg. After coal comes out of the ground, it typically goes on a conveyor belt to a preparation plant that is located at the mining site. The plant cleans and processes coal to remove dirt, rock, ash, sulfur, and other unwanted materials, increasing the heating value of the coal.

## Coal Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

The first method consists in extracting coal while leaving "pillars" to support the roof of the mine. The second method envisages the use of a series of supporting structures called "scaffoldings" which can be easily removed and support the roof in the mining area.
