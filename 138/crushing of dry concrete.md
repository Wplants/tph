## Can I Pour Dry Concrete Then Add Water? | BagOfConcrete
Yes, you can pour dry concrete, and then add water, but it is not recommended. While some people use dry concrete to fill in gaps and fence posts in the ground, water should still be added to ensure that the concrete hardens. However, any job that requires a stable foundation should not be completed with dry-pouring concrete.

The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.

If the ambient relative humidity is lower, like, 60%, the equilibrium moisture content of concrete is also lower, at 3.9%. As a matter of fact, at lower humidity, concrete with a 5.5% moisture content is still wet, and it has approximately 6.6 gallons per cubic meter more moisture to dry out of it. Concrete relative humidity.
