## Ironmaking in Rotary Hearth Furnace - IspatGuru
Ironmaking in the rotary hearth furnace (RHF) is a direct reduction process which utilizes non-coking coal for the reduction of iron ore. The RHF is the process reactor which consists of a flat, refractory hearth rotating inside a stationary, circular tunnel kiln. Inside the RHF, direct reduction of iron ore or iron-bearing waste materials

The largest furnace that Electric Smelters has built is smelting 100 tons of iron ore in Norway (per day, presumably). This was erected in 1916 but is not mentioned in Millers report of 1936 cited later. The smallest furnace has a capacity of 750 pounds in 24- hours and is employed for reducing precipitates.

Iron oxide, in pellet or lump form, is introduced through a proportioning hopper at the top of the shaft furnace. As the iron ore descends through the furnace by gravity flow, it is heated, and the oxygen is removed from the iron ore (reduction) by counterflowing gases that have a high H₂ and CO content. These gases react with the .

 The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production ).

Currently the dominating process for the iron ore reduction is the blast furnace BF technology. These furnaces consist of a moving bed reactor with a counter current flow of the solid reactants against a reducing gas. Not only are the energy costs relatively high for these blast furnaces the pollution problems can also be quite severe.

In both cases, the objective of the process is to remove the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)).

How is iron produced? Iron is produced by reduction of iron ore, which is often a mixture of oxides, using carbon, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen.  Most ores contain more than 60% iron and are used in their mineral state in a blast furnace. Ore containing less than this is first crushed and ground into a powder and concentrated by flotation.

## furnaces for iron ore reduction
Currently the dominating process for the iron-ore reduction is the blast furnace (BF) technology. These furnaces consist of a moving bed reactor with a counter-current flow of the solid reactants against a reducing gas. Not only are the energy costs relatively high for these blast furnaces the pollution problems can also be quite severe.

## USA - Methods and furnaces for steel manufacture by direct 
Improvements in method and apparatus for manufacturing and melting of iron from dressed ore or pellets, carried out in two steps, wherein the first step is a pre-reduction step in which reduction is made by a reduction gas passed through a pellet layer or contacted a flow of dressed ore said gas then being passed through a gas-permeable meltable charge and drawn off, and the second step is a

## [Exploring Hydrogen with POSCO #3] The Future of Steel — Hydrogen-based 
The blast furnace produces molten iron, which is then put back into the converter to make them into molten steel. Carbon monoxide is used as the reducing agent here. In FINEX, where no blast furnace is in use, the iron ore fine is put into the fluidized reduction furnace to produce DRI. The DRI then goes into a melter gasifier, where it changes
