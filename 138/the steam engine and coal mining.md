## Steam engine
A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder.This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work.The term "steam engine" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just

The development of factories by Arkwright and the improvement of the steam engine by Watt further increased demand for coal. As a result, coal mines got deeper and deeper and coal mining became more and more dangerous. Coal shafts could go hundreds of feet into the ground. Once a coal seam was found, the miners dug horizontally.

In .15, boilers consume 3.6MW of coal (to produce 1.8MW of steam which can feed exactly two steam engines). Given that a unit of coal has 8MJ energy, a boiler at full capacity requires 3.6/8=.45 coal per second or 27 coal per minute. A mine still produces .525 coal per second or 31.5 per minute. So, a fuel yellow belt of coal:

## The Steam Engine | Environment & Society Portal
The Steam Engine. Initiated by the growing need for raw materials, the development of steam power set off a chain reaction. In order to pump pit water out of mines, steam engines were built near mining sites. Because these steam engines were powered by coal, coal mining became profitable—a mutually beneficial system.

A Newcomen steam-engine being used in about 1780. In 1763 James Watt was sent a steam engine produced by Thomas Newcomen to repair. Although many mine-owners used Newcomen's steam-engines, they constantly complained about the cost of using them. The main problem with it was they needed a great deal of coal and were therefore expensive to run.

The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today

As mining went deeper, winding machines improved. A winding engine is a large winch which hauled cages up and down the vertical mineshaft.

Fairbottom Bobs, a Newcomen steam engine recovered from a mine site in Lancashire, England, was acquired in 1930 by the Henry Ford Museum, which says it is possibly the oldest extant steam engine in the world.  Despite its appetite for coal, however, examples of the Newcomen engine were still in operation as late as the 1900s.
