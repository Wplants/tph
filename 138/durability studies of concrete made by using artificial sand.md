Mechanical and durability properties of concrete made . The study conducted by Columbia University on mortars and concretes manufactured by replacing raw sand with dredged marine material of a very fine fraction (10 Î¼m) revealed that the strength reached by those made with part of dredged material was lower than that of the control mixture, and the mixtures were less workable.
