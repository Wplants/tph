Mechanical and durability properties of concrete made . The study conducted by Columbia University on mortars and concretes manufactured by replacing raw sand with dredged marine material of a very fine fraction (10 μm) revealed that the strength reached by those made with part of dredged material was lower than that of the control mixture, and the mixtures were less workable.
