## Why Do Metals Conduct Electricity? - Materials Science & Engineering 
In this post, I will explain why metals are such good electrical conductors, and also explain how nonmetals like water and glass can also become conductors. Metals conduct electricity because they have "free electrons.". Unlike most other forms of matter, metallic bonding is unique because the electrons are not bound to a particular atom.

## French researchers claim to have created metallic hydrogen in a lab 
"It may exhibit a room temperature superconductivity, a melting transition at very low temperature into an unusual superconducting- superfluid state, a high protonic diffusion and a high energy density storage." This means that the material can store energy very easily and it can conduct electricity perhaps indefinitely at room temperature.

## Why do metals conduct heat and electricity so well? - Edinformatics
Metals contain free moving delocalized electrons. When electric voltage is applied, an electric field within the metal triggers the movement of the electrons, making them shift from one end to another end of the conductor. Electrons will move toward the positive side. Metal is a good conduction of heat.

Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity. It represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. It is commonly signified by the Greek letter σ ( sigma ), but κ ( kappa) (especially in electrical engineering) and γ ( gamma) are sometimes used.

## The ability to conduct electricity is one of the key properties of a m 
The ability of metals to conduct electricity is due to how their atoms bond together. In order to bond together the metal atoms lose at least one of their outermost electrons. This leaves the metal atoms with a positive charge and they are now strictly ions. The lost electrons are free to move in what are known as a sea of electrons.
