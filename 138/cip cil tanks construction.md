After the four-stage reflux adsorption of the slurry, the gold grade has dropped from 11.92 g / ton to 0.015 g / ton, the adsorption rate of activated carbon is 99.2%, the recovery rate of gold is 90-94%, which can save 25% of capital construction costs and 6% of production costs compared with the zinc powder replacement method.

CIP/CIL/CIC Adsorption Circuit Process Selection. Chris A.

The first two processes recover gold directly from pulps or slurries containing up to 55% solids, while the CIC process is used for treatment of solution

Remember the CIP has a solution profile with the feed tank having a high solution grade. So with less carbon in the first tanks will results in high loading but less gold due to less carbon quantity. This will further put pressure on the downstream tanks resulting in loss of gold. It is advisable though to top up carbon on the last tank.

Cip Cil Tanks Construction. In carbon-in-pulp CIP and carbon-in-leach CIL processes, especially those utilizing pure oxygen instead of normal air to increase the overall efficiency of the cyanide leaching-adsorption process in the recovery of gold and/or silver from ores, the screen within each tank which surrounds the slurry outlet is kept clean

## Gold CIP CIL Plant _The Nile Co., Ltd.
CIL is cyanide gold extraction process. Firstly, raw material is crushed into less than 10mm by different types of crushers; secondly, crushed material will be ground and classified into 90% of 200mesh, then fine powder will get into thickner, after concentration, add chemical and leach in the leaching tank. After leaching, we can use activated
