Jan 27, 2021The crushed sand is of cubical shape with grounded edges, washed and graded to as a construction material. The size of manufactured sand (M-Sand) is less than 4.75mm. Its significance: It can be dust free, the sizes of m-sand can be controlled easily so that it meets the required grading for the given construction.

Shyam Prakash et la. 2007 says that manufactured sand satisfies the requirements fine aggregates such as strength, graduation, shape angularity. It is also possible to produce manufactured sand falling into the desired grade. They say that the mechanical properties of manufactured sand depend upon the source of its raw material, i.e., parent rock.

## Manufactured sand - a solution to the global sand shortage?
The use of manufactured sand makes sense from various perspectives. First, manufactured sand is more uniform in structure compared with natural sand. It also has an advantage when it comes to concrete production, because manufactured sand is less needed in the concrete mix by a margin of 5 to 20% compared with natural sand to fill the voids

## Manufactured Sand Properties
Apr 29, 2017 Manufactured sand / M-Sand is a fine aggregate, which is an Eco-friendly and economical alternative to river sand. It is manufactured by crushing suitable stones and are finely graded to match the IS standard requirements. There are three types of m sand that are produced. The properties of the M-sand are listed below: Get Price

This can help in reducing the sand mining from river beds. Lesser impurities and good working properties: Manufactured sand is free of silt and clay particles, and has denser particle packing than natural sand. It also offers higher flexural strength, better abrasion resistance, higher unit weight and lower permeability.
