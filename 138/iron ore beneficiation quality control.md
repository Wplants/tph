This saves mining operations multiple millions in USD every month since iron ore beneficiation increases significantly the costs per ton of ore. Control of the moisture content on the mining conveyor belt (NIR) together with accurate monitoring of the composition of iron ore before shipment guaranties constant ore quality to avoids penalties.
