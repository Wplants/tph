While radiation levels are not typically high, measurement of specific samples may reveal higher than expected levels on a case-by-case basis. Granite is a naturally occurring igneous rock, meaning that it was formed by the cooling of molten rock. It is quarried and processed to produce commercial products such as countertops.

The rate at which rock dust dissolves and releases its nutrients depends on the type of rock, the type of soil, the pH of soil, climate, and the mineral balance in the soil (ie presence of other minerals). There is almost zero dissolution in alkaline soil, and a much higher rate in very acidic soil. Low mineral, tropical soils dissolve faster

Two heuristics guide most crushing operations: (1) lower reduction ratios reduce fines generation and (2) choke-feeding the crushers produces better shaped aggregate but more fines. Table 1. Crushers and production characteristics. Input in italics: gathered from 35 granite quarries in Georgia as part of this study.

## Understanding rock and gravel grades and uses | MDI Rock
Crushed rock costs Costs for rock can vary widely depending on the type of material you're using and how much you're purchasing. One survey of suppliers around the country found prices ranged from $27.50 per ton for basic crushed stone (when purchased in a large quantity of 23 tons or more) to as much as $64.20 per ton for white marble

limestone and marble. In the case of granite, quartz and feldspar grains do not deform plastically at low confinement, and crack propagation continues in the direction of the applied load (Gramberg, 1989). Hence, granite and marble-both coarse-grained rocks with planar pre-existing cracks-fail very differently. 3.1. Experimental study
