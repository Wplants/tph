## What is the process of producing phosphoric acid?
In these processes, phosphoric acid can be obtained by digesting phosphate rock in mineral acids such as nitric, hydrochloric, phosphoric or sulfuric. The use of sulfuric acid is a common method and is commonly referred to as the "wet process". In this process, calcium sulfate precipitates as a by-product. Depending on the temperature as

Thermal process phosphoric acid is of a much higher purity and is used in the manufacture of high grade chemicals, pharmaceuticals, detergents, food products, beverages, and other nonfertilizer products. In 1987, over 9 million megagrams (Mg) (9.9 million tons) of wet process phosphoric acid was produced in the form of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).

## How to produce phosphoric acid? Explained by FAQ Blog
Which is the economic process for manufacture of phosphoric acid? There are two main commercial processes to produce phosphoric acid: the wet process and the dry [1] (electrical furnace) process.Although, the acid produced (technical grade) with the dry process is pure, its production cost is much higher than that of the wet process phosphoric acid (WPPA or fertilizer grade acid).
