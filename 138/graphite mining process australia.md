## Climate-change impacts of graphite production - GoodElectronics
Around 75,000 tonnes of graphite is required to create 1 million EVs, meaning that to produce 12 million EVs will need 900,000 tonnes of graphite by 2025. Producing anode grade graphite for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is energy-intensive. In many countries where they depend on coal for electricity, it means they use more coal to do this process.

Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.

## 5 Stages of Graphite Processing | Mining Pedia
Jun 11, 2021The process of graphite beneficiation is mainly: crushing-grinding-separation-middling treatment-tailings treatment. 1. Crushing. The hardness of graphite ore is generally medium-hard or medium-hard to soft. The grade of the raw ore is between 2-10%, and the crushing process is relatively simple. For plants of the same scale, relatively small
