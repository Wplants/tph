## Management of coal processing wastes: studies on an alternate 
Management of coal mining and coal processing wastes, particularly of high sulfur coals, can generate excessive amounts of sulfate (SO4 2−) and chloride (Cl−) in mine drainage that are known to negatively impact quality of both surface and ground water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides guidance to states on allowable SO4 2− and Cl− discharges from mine sites. This
