## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand & Aggregate in M20, M15 
Solution: In case of M10 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 3 : 6. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete × 1.54. Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 3 × 1.54 = 4.62 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio ÷ Sum of all ratio) × Total volume of concrete = = 0.462m 3.

Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.

## How Cement, Sand and Aggregate ratios influence Concrete  - Happho
Total Aggregate by cement ratio (A/C) decreases with increase in grade of concrete. For example, M20 grade of aggregate will have a higher A/C ratio than of M30. Higher the Aggregate/Cement ratio leaner the concrete mix, as cement content is lower. Concrete mix can be made more workable by fine tuning Aggregate/Cement ratio.

## How many bags of cement and sand and gravel are in 1 cubic meter?
There is a 1:2:3 ratio of bags of cement and sand and gravel in 1 cubic meter. As a general rule of thumb, you can approximate this by percentage: If the total number of units of cement and aggregates in 4.5 cubic meters of concrete at a 1:2:3 ratio is 6. One-sixth of an inch equals 0.75 centimeters of cement.
