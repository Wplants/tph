## How Mines can Improve Water Usage
1 day agoMining relies on water. Even though mines consume between 2 and 5 percent of South Africa's available water, that's substantially less usage than agriculture (61%), domestic/municipal use (27%) and industry (7%), based on research by the CSIR. Yet while mining has a relatively smaller consumption footprint, it's still often wasteful.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

## How Mines can Improve Water Usage
Mining relies on water. Even though mines consume between 2 and 5 percent of South Africa's available water, that's substantially less usage than agriculture (61%), domestic/municipal use (27%) and industry (7%), based on research by the CSIR. Yet while mining has a relatively smaller consumption footprint, it's still often wasteful.
