## Understanding the Impact of Recycled Glass on the Environment — Green 
By recycling existing glass products, you can cut down the energy required to produce new glass. Glass is recycled by crushing it into tiny particles, called a cullet. Then it is heavily processed to make a new glass product. This method of creating new glass products from recycled glass saves 20-40% of energy on average.

## Turning Waste Glass Into Expanded Glass - Concrete Decor
Historically, repurposing glass for use in concrete mixtures has simply involved crushing and grinding the glass to a smaller size. Resizing alone doesn't bring glass processing far enough to create a functional raw material for the concrete industry.  Expanding glass is a process where crushed glass cullet is upcycled on the particle size
