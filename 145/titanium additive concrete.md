How much steel fiber is added to a concrete mix depends on the objectives: cost savings, increased joint spacing, or structural improvement. Steel fiber dosages can be as light as 8 pounds to as much as 200 pounds per cubic yard. Increasing the percentage of fibers in a mix allows specifiers to increase the distance between joints.

Selective Laser Melting. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an Additive Manufacturing technology that uses metal powder to create your parts. The metal 3D printer spreads a thin layer of the metal powder on the bed, then a laser melts the metal creating the shape of your 3D model. The next layer of powder is placed and the process repeats itself.
