## Pyrite Mining - JXSC Mining
Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.
