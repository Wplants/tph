## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
The open-pit mining cycle includes drilling ore and waste rock, loading drill holes with explosives, blasting, ore loading and hauling to stockpiles for processing, waste rock loading and hauling to the waste rock storage pile. Occasionally, drilling and blasting ore is not required and can simply be removed by what is known as free digging.

## TSHA | Iron Ore Deposits - Handbook of Texas
In the 1970s the Lone Star and Tex-Iron plants recovered ore from open-pit mines in Cass, Morris, and Nacogdoches counties in the northeastern part of the state to produce pig iron and cement.  The last mining of iron ore for metal manufacture ceased in the mid-1980s, when Lone Star Steel terminated work at its Cass County mine. Primary

## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Jan 7, 2021Open-pit mining differs from quarrying (with the possible exception of iron ore) in that the valuable mineral constitutes only a small proportion of the total tonnage of rock produced. In quarrying, the rock itself is the valuable commodity, with virtually all of the raw rock that is won being processed (often only by crushing and screening) to

## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Open pit mining is one of mankind's greatest achievements in the ongoing search for precious ores such as copper, silver, iron, and gold.  There was a time when the most common way to extract ore was shaft mining resulting in thousands of deaths.

## What Is Open Pit Mining? | An Underground Miner
Jul 25, 2022Strip mining is a surface technique where workers clear vegetation, waste rock, and overburden from the ground. Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface. Open-pit mining differs as workers excavate large landscapes on deeper slopes, separated by "benches."

## Open Pit Mining Techniques|Surface Mines|Rock or Mineral Extraction
Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.

## Open Pit Mining - IntechOpen
Feb 17, 2021Open pit mining is widely used with metallic ore bodies (aluminum, bauxite, copper, iron), and nearly all nonmetallic (coal, uranium, phosphate, etc.). It is a traditional cone-shaped excavation (although it can be of any shape, depending on the size and shape of the ore body) that is used when the ore body is typically pipe-shaped, vein-type

## Geology and mining — MineFacts
The location of the deposit decides which type of mine can be set up. For example, an open pit mine cannot be started if the deposit is at a depth of 1,000 m. The quantity of ore extracted every year, the rate of extraction, differs between different types of mine. An open pit means that more ore can be extracted at a lower extraction cost.

When would open-pit mining be most useful? 4.2 Open-pit mining Open-pit mining is probably most advanced because of developments in mining low-grade copper deposits and iron ore. It is suitable for much of the resource if it is done on a large scale and will allow low-cost removal of most of the resource.
