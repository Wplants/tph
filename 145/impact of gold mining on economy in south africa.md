## The Impact of Mining on The South African Economy and Living Standards 
As one of South Africa's leading economic historians, Hobart Houghton noted, South African mining has always been an epic of applied science. Professor Chris Barnard put South African surgery on the global map with the world's first heart transplant in 1967, but South African mining engineering had long since already been on that map.

## Mining: a brief history | Statistics South Africa
Mining's contribution to total economic production climbed in the 1970s to peak at 21% in 1980 1. Contributing to the upward surge in 1980 was a relatively high gold price. In other words, for every R100 that the South African economy produced that year, R21 was due to mining. In 1987, employment in the industry peaked at just over 760 000

On 22 June, four suspected illegal miners were found dead with gunshot wounds to the head at a gold mine near Johannesburg. Earlier this year, a rescue operation to remove illegal miners from the abandoned Gold One mineshaft on South Africa's East Rand, revealed a reluctance to be rescued for fear of arrest. This brings to attention the scale and intractability of efforts to curb illegal mining.

For 130 years South Africa has been exploiting its gold resources in Johannesburg. But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.
