## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Jaw crushers are primary crushers used in an ore processing or mining plants. The size of these jaw crushers is determined by the square or rectangular opening from the feed opening (top of the jaws). For example, the 24 X 36 jaw crusher will have an opening of 24″ X 36″. while a 56 X 56 jaw crusher will have an opening of 56″ square.

## What Is a Jaw Crusher and What Can It Do for You?
A jaw crusher is one of several types of crushers, including impactors, hammermills, and cone crushers, that are manufactured for the purpose of processing aggregate minerals, RAP, and recycled concrete with rebar, to name a few applications.  The final output size is determined by a preset crushing size in the chamber's bottom.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

Since the comparative reduction capacity of the jaw crusher is given, the crusher dimensions may now be determined. For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape.
