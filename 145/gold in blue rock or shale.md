Aug 02, 2020 Shale is the most common sedimentary rock, accounting for about 70 percent of the rock in the Earth's crust. Shale is a fine-grained rock made from compacted mud and clay. The defining characteristic of shale is its ability to break into layers or fissility. Black and gray shale are common, but the rock can occur in any color.

The defining characteristic of shale is its ability to break into layers or fissility. Black and gray shale are common, but the rock can occur in any color. Get

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

Firstly, Gold possesses a yellowish streak while pyrite has a greenish-black kind of streak. The second one has to do with the hardness. Gold comes with a Mohs hardness of about 2.5 while pyrite measures about 6. Also, gold will not scratch a copper surface but copper will certainly scratch copper.

## Shale: Identification, Characteristics, and More - Rockhound Resource
Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay minerals and other clay-sized particles of minerals like quartz and calcite. It is laminated and fissile, easily breaking along bedding planes. Shale forms from the deposition and compaction of clay-sized minerals in a low-energy environment.

## How to Identify Raw Gold | Sciencing
Perform a simple test of the material in the pan to assess whether it is real gold. Raw gold appears brassy yellow and bright. If you think it is gold, place your hand between it and the sun to create shade over the gold. If it still appears bright in the pan, chances are that it is real gold. Fool's gold does not appear as bright when shaded.
