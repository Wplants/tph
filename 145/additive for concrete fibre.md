## Concrete additives - 21st Century Concrete Inc.
Steel fiber reinforcement will deliver a concrete floor system with less cracking, greater impact resistance and overall increased durability, while saving days in the construction process. We use the American Concrete Institute Committee's 544 as our guideline in designing steel fiber concrete slabs in order to meet required building codes.

## Concrete Reinforcing Fibers - Sika
Fiber reinforced concrete is a composite material and therefore, all fibers are tested in the concrete to prove their performance. Fibers begin to function in a structural supportive manner when the concrete matrix starts to crack, just like traditional reinforcement. The crack has to occur for the load to switch from the concrete to the

## Performance Assessment of Fiber-Reinforced Concrete Produced with Waste 
Neves and Almeida stated in their study that fiber additives increase the compressive strength of concrete up to 1.5%, but decrease the Young's modulus slightly. However, it is understood from the graph that there is a very good increase in Young's modulus with the addition of lathe waste chips.

## Argentina Fiber Concrete Additive
Samples with a single hooked-end steel fiber, with and without expansive additive were manufactured and tested in the developed mold geometry. The results show that restrained concrete expansion positively affects single fiber pull-out behavior, i.e. fibeased by 29.7 % and pull-out peak load by 10.8 %.

## How to Use Steel Fibers in Concrete - Concrete Construction
How much steel fiber is added to a concrete mix depends on the objectives: cost savings, increased joint spacing, or structural improvement. Steel fiber dosages can be as light as 8 pounds to as much as 200 pounds per cubic yard. Increasing the percentage of fibers in a mix allows specifiers to increase the distance between joints.
