## Understanding US iron ore production | CRU
The cost of getting iron ore in and out of the Great Lakes is simply too high for any major trade to take place with the rest of the world. Therefore, the USA remains a very marginal player in the seaborne iron ore market. In 2019, seaborne iron ore exports are expected to be ~3 Mt, which accounts for ~0.2% of global seaborne trade.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world.
