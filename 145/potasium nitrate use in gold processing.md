## Potassium Nitrate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Potassium nitrate contains a single nitrogen. Its frequency is higher than that of the nitrate ion in ammonium nitrate. The T 1 s and T 2e s of the two nitrate ion transitions are similar; therefore, their detection sensitivities are similar. The potassium ion also can be detected by NQR. Its resonance is higher in frequency than the nitrogen and its T 1 is shorter, but its line is broader and
