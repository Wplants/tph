##  Diamond Mining and The Environment Fact Sheet
Diamond mining uses water, rather than chemicals, for extraction, but of course, water is scarce in many parts of Africa, where diamond mining companies often operate. This makes it even more important that the diamond mining process does not pollute natural water sources and that it uses as little as possible. Taking action

Layers of earth and rock are first removed and the ore beneath is blasted to allow for removal. The rough material is loaded onto trucks and transported to an industrial crusher.

In this stage, the ore are scrubbed to remove loose excess material and is screened. Material smaller than 1.5mm is discarded because it is too costly to extract diamonds from such a small piece of ore.
