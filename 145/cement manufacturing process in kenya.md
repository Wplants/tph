## Cement Manufacturing Process - Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

Cement Manufacturing Process Phase II: Proportioning, Blending & Grinding. The raw materials from quarry are now routed in plant laboratory where, they are analyzed and proper proportioning of limestone and clay are making possible before the beginning of grinding. Generally, limestone is 80% and remaining 20% is the clay.

The main airborne pollutants of cement production to the environment are dust and gases emitted during the process. Many studies has been carried out to improve the knowledge of matter. Hindyet from his experiments reported that in Egypt, 1 kg of cement manufacture generates about 0.07 kg of dust in the atmosphere.
