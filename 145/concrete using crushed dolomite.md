## Dolomite rock sand as fine aggregate replacement in construction 
Specific gravity of fine aggregate is the ratio of the weight of given volume of aggregates to the weight of equal volume of water. Specific gravity of fine aggregates (crushed sand and Dolomite Rock Sand) were found by using a pycnometer and the test standards were ensured to conform with IS 2386 (Part 3) 1963. The results are presented in Fig. 1.
