## Design and Analysis of Metal Oxides for CO2 Reduction Using Machine 
We aim to achieve resource recycling by capturing and using CO2 generated in a chemical production and disposal process. We focused on CO2 conversion to CO by the reverse water gas shift-chemical looping (RWGS-CL) reaction. This reaction proceeds in two steps (H2 + MOx â H2O + MOx-1; CO2 + MOx-1 â CO + MOx) via a metal oxide that acts as an oxygen carrier. High CO2 conversion can be

## How do I calculate the actual concentration of a metal from the ICP-MS 
You have a dilution factor 0.5 in 50mL in this case 100. If the output from your instrument is 263.7ppb you multiply this with your dilution factor hence x100. Depending what units your ICP-MS
