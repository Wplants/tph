It is composed of hydrated aluminum oxides, hydrated aluminosilicates, iron oxides, hydrated iron oxides, titanium oxide, and silica.  First the alumina is extracted from bauxite ore usually using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, finely crushed bauxite is mixed with sodium hydroxide and placed in a `digester.

## Bauxite extraction
The extraction of the metal from bauxite involves the three main steps. Concentration of Bauxite Concentration of ore is done by leaching which helps in removing impurities like F e 2 O 3, S i O 2, etc. Bauxite is treated with N a O H to form sodium aluminate which on further reaction with C O 2 gives pure Alumina.

Bauxite (Fig. 1.33) is formed by surface weathering of clay rocks around the tropical region and composer of aluminum oxide (Al (OH) 3). It contains 15%-25% aluminum and only ore used for commercial extraction for aluminum. The bauxite occurs as near-surface layers and usually mixed with clay minerals, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Extraction of iron and aluminum from high-iron bauxite by ammonium 
High iron content is one of the challenges in utilizing the refractory bauxites in China. An improved method for treating the high-iron bauxite by roasting with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 was proposed, which offers a possible alternative method for utilizing the high-iron bauxite. The influences of the roasting time, roasting temperature, material ratio, and ore particle size on the extraction ratios of Fe
