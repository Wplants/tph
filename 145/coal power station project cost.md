## Fossil fuel power station
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity.Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator.The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating gas engine.

## Converting a Power Plant from Coal to Natural Gas
There are numerous factors which must be considered when evaluating the possibility of a coal to natural gas conversion project, such as cost (both short term and long term), access to fuel supply, emissions, and impacts to power plant performance. Each factor must be evaluated to determine if a fuel conversion is feasible.

## Carry on coal? The cost of keeping the UK's dirty power stations alive 
Parson Brinkerhoff's figures seem to suggest it could be around ¬£147 million to keep an average-sized 1,000 megawatt coal power plant going for an extra 10 years. The main bulk of that cost comes from upgrading the plant's technology to meet new pollution standards - that technology could cost ¬£130 million to install on an average-sized

## Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2020 - Analysis - IEA
The cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants remains stable, yet electricity from the long-term operation of nuclear power plants constitutes the least cost option for low-carbon generation. At the assumed carbon price of USD 30 per tonne of CO2 and pending a breakthrough in carbon capture and storage, coal-fired power generation is
