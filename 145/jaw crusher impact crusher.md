Impact Crusher can crush many kinds of materials with max feed size less than 500mm and crushing strength less than 360 MP. The most outstanding advantage of impact crusher is that its finished powder is in good, cubic shape, non-tensile and cranny.  The big raw gypsum is fed to the jaw crusher evenly and gradually by vibrating feeder

## Material Quality of Impact Crushers vs. Jaw Crushers
Dec 20, 2021The impact crusher is an explosion crusher that impacts and explodes material. The quality of the finished product does depend on one's perspective of exactly what the target is. If one's target is to produce fines, the impact crusher may be a better choice. If the target is a coarser blend of material, the jaw crusher may be best.
