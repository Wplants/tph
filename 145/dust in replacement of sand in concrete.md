## Studies on quarry dust as partial replacement of fine  - SlideShare
Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M20 concrete is prepared with reference

## Effect of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.

## Strength Characteristics of Quarry Dust in Replacement of Sand
Abstract. The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem. The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason to search as a alternative material.

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

## Performance of Concrete Incorporating Limestone Dust as Partial 
The incorporation of up to IO percent limestone dust as a partial replacement for fine aggregate in concrete with a 0.70 water-cement ratio and 5 percent limestone dust in concrete with a 0.53 water-cement ratio does not significantly affect the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The loss in entrained-air content can be easily overcome

suitability of those properties to enable quarry dust (Celik et. al., 1996) to be used as partial replacement material for sand in concrete. The use of quarry dust in concrete is desirable because of its benefits such as useful disposal of by products, reduction of river sand consumption as well as increasing the strength

##  International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring 
This present work is an attempt to use Quarry Dust as partial replacement for Sand in concrete. Attempts have been made to study the properties of concrete and to investigate some properties of Quarry Dust the suitability of those properties to enable them to be used as partial replacement materials for sand in concrete. Key Words: Quarry Dust
