The Mesh Total Open Area for a screen = hole area x number of holes. Drum Open Area (expressed as a percentage) of a screen mesh or plate is the % of Mesh Total Open Area compared to the total area of the drum. So the fewer gaps between holes and the less closed plate (ie no holes) through the drum the higher the open area.
