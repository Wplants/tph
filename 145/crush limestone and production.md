To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

## Crushed limestone as an aggregate in concrete production: the Cyprus 
Limestones in Cyprus are mainly quarried for the production of coarse and fine aggregates to be used in concrete. The objective of this paper is to examine the properties of crushed limestone aggregates. The petrographical and physico-mechanical properties of these aggregates are described and their suitability for concrete production is examined.
