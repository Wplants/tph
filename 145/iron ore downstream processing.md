## Brumadinho dam disaster
The Brumadinho dam disaster occurred on 25 January 2019 when Dam I, a tailings dam at the Córrego do Feijão iron ore mine, 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) east of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, suffered a catastrophic failure. The dam is owned by Vale, the same company that was involved in the 2015 Mariana dam disaster. The dam released a mudflow that advanced through the mine's offices, including

Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.

Dynamic Cast : A cast is an operator that converts data from one type to another type. In C++, dynamic casting is mainly used for safe downcasting at run time. To work on dynamic_cast there must be one virtual function in the base class. A dynamic_cast works only polymorphic base class because it uses this information to decide safe downcasting.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Royalties on iron ore were raised from 10 to 15% in 2014. As a result, from being the world's third largest iron ore exporter in 2011, India became a net importer of iron ore in 2014. Although exports have recovered somewhat since then, they are still dramatically lower than they were before the taxes were introduced (Östensson and Löf 2017).
