Commonly, extracting lithium from these deposits involves two methods. One is building a mine, extracting the clay or ore, and separating the metal through a complex process. The second is to pump underground water deposits to the surface. The resulting pools of briny liquid are left to evaporate, and lithium is removed from the dried salts.

The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.

Seawater contains 5,000 times the amount of lithium found on land, but only in very low concentrations, which has made previous attempts to extract lithium from the ocean ineffective.

## Lithium ore processing - an overview of the current and new  - AusIMM
The current surge of interest in lithium (Li) is due to the anticipated demand for electric vehicles and small scale power storage. Brine deposits contain most of the global Li resource, however hard rock deposits can be more readily and rapidly developed and comprise the majority of proposed projects. These projects plan to use the conventional processing routes of dense medium separation and
