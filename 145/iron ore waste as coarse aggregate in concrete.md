## Recycled Aggregates - Cement
Concrete recycling gains importance because it protects natural resources and eliminates the need for disposal by using the readily available concrete as an aggregate source for new concrete or other applications. According to a 2004 FHWA study, 38 states recycle concrete as an aggregate base; 11 recycle it into new portland cement concrete

## Industrial Waste Aggregates | SpringerLink
Abstract. The aggregates typically account for 70-80 % of the concrete volume and play a substantial role in different concrete properties such as workability, strength, dimensional stability and durability. Conventional concrete consists of sand as fine aggregate and gravel, limestone or granite in various sizes and shapes as coarse aggregate.

Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

## Glass Waste as Coarse Aggregate Filler Replacement in Concrete
Glass waste in the form of discarded glass bottles was broken into 5-20 mm fragments sizes and is used as coarse aggregates substitute in amounts of 5, 10, and 15%, respectively. The glass waste concrete samples were tested and evaluated for compressive strength after 7 and 28 days of curing to determine the concrete's strength.

## Construction
Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, [1] and comes from Latin constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction. [2] To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure.

## Recovering Iron from Iron Ore Tailings and Preparing Concrete Composite 
Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate. In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues. Based on the
