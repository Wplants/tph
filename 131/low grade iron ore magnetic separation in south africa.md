## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

##  Beneficiation of a low-grade iron ore by combination of wet low 
low-grade iron ores can be listed as the mineralogical and textural complexity, high silica content, soft nature of some iron minerals, and variability of iron minerals [2, 3]. The upgradation of an iron ore (42.98% Fe) with wet low-intensity magnetic separation (WLIMS) was investigated by Dewari et al. [4, 5]. A

Present Practice and State of Development. The largest development in the iron-ore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used.

When the grinding particle size is greater than 0.2mm, most iron ore magnetic separation plants usually use one stage grinding-magnetic separation;  However, due to the low grade of strong magnetic separation concentrates of most weak magnetic iron ore, and the low processing capacity of the gravity separation process unit, the combined

## Potential low-grade iron ore deposits in metamorphosed  - DeepDyve
Exploitation of low-grade iron ore would be quite unique in a South African context as South Africa is well endowed with high-grade iron ore resources. Low-grade iron ore, defined as containing between 20 and 47% iron, is thought to be the primary iron-bearing lithology from which most high-grade ore deposits formed, through different processes of enrichment.
