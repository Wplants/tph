## Mushroom Farms Products | CO2Meter
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced during the mushroom's growth in compost, which negatively affects mushroom growth during pinning. This makes proper ventilation essential. Pinning is the trickiest part for a mushroom grower since a combination of CO2 concentration, temperature, light, and humidity triggers mushrooms towards fruiting.
