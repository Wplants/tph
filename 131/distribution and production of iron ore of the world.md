iron powder production capacity is reported to be around 29,000 metric tons per year, with BASF being the largest manufacturer. However, nearly half of the current carbonyl iron powder capacity is represented by recent additions from China. Carbonyls of nickel and iron, of molecular forms Ni(CO) 4 and Fe(CO) 5, were discovered by Dr Ludwig Mond.
