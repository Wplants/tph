Banded Iron Formation. Source: Flickr. These strange rocks are known as Banded Iron Formations, or BIFs. They were deposited when oxygen reacted with the iron-rich Archean ocean water to form iron oxides. During the Archean, not very much oxygen was being produced, and most of it was reacting with iron in the oceans. The reaction produced iron

Tiger iron is found within banded iron formations, ranging from around 1.8 to 2.8 billion years old. How Is Tiger Iron Formed? Tiger iron was formed either directly or indirectly by ancient, oxygen producing cyanobacteria. Oxygen was not present in the early atmosphere, but arose as a byproduct of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria.

Banded iron formations are almost exclusively Precambrian in age, with most deposits dating to the late Archean ( Ma) with a secondary peak of deposition in the Orosirian period of the Paleoproterozoic (1850 Ma). Minor amounts were deposited in the early Archean and in the Neoproterozoic (750 Ma). The youngest known banded iron formation is an Early Cambrian formation in western China.

Summary: Banded-iron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary mineral deposits consisting of alternating beds of iron-rich minerals (mostly hematite) and silica-rich layers (chert or quartz) formed about 3.0 to 1.8 billion years ago.Theory suggests BIFs are associated with the capture of oxygen released by photosynthetic processes by iron dissolved in ancient ocean water.

Remember that iron rusts when it reacts with oxygen giving it a red tint. So over time, the seafloor collected rusted iron. This rusted iron is in the different layers of banded iron formation (BIF) created about 3.7 billion years ago. The alternating layers in banded iron formations represent rock being oxidized.
