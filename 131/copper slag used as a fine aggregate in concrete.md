Curing concrete gives off heat, that is why, during the Hoover Damn construction they used refrigderation to cool the concrete . The above page has a great description of hydration, or the process by which the concrete cures to hardness. The hydration continues for many years after the initial pour, causing the concrete to get harder as it ages.
