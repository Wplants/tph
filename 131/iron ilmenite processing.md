In India, ilmenite is considered as a major mineral reserve for the extraction of titanium. During the processing of ilmenite to produce titanium dioxide, huge amount of iron oxide is generated and dumped as waste. According to an approximation, 0.7 ton of iron oxide waste is generated for one ton of synthetic rutile production. This waste iron oxide has great potential to be utilized as
