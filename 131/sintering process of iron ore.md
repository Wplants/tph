Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

The process of sintering is a thermal operation involving melting and assimilation reactions. The first stage of the sintering process is the formation of the melt which involves the reaction between fine iron ore particles and fluxes.

## How to determine sintering temperature?
A sintering furnace is used during the sintering process, which involves heating powder compacts to increase the product's mechanical strength, density, and translucency. Sintering ovens must be able to maintain heating temperatures below the product's melting point, as the goal is not to liquefy the material.

## Difference Between Calcination and Sintering | Compare the Difference 
The key difference between calcination and sintering is that calcination is the heating of metal ore to remove impurities, whereas sintering is the heating of metal ore to weld together small particles of a metal.. Calcination and sintering are two different pyrometallurgical processes. However, both these processes involve the heating of a metallic material to a temperature that is below the

Jun 1, 2022Iron ore sintering is a crucial stage in the whole steelmaking flow, the function of which is to process iron ores (< 8 mm) into lumpy sinter, thereby providing raw materials for ironmaking [1,2,3,4,5]. The sintering heat originates from fuel combustion, either complete combustion or incomplete combustion.
