A large hydraulic hammer is used to break oversized boulders in preparation for the crushing process. A front-end loader now digs into the face of the blast rock and loads it on off-road haul trucks to be transported to the crushing facility. Impact crushers are feed this conglomerated material sizing from four feet in diameter to fine particles.

## Crushed Stone Aggregates - Lehigh Hanson, Inc.
Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing
