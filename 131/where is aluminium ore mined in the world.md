First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.  There was great demand for aluminium during the World War II and the Korean War as planes had previously been made of wood and fabric. 1922: Aluminium foil

Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which will form the basis of post-mining revegetation of the site. Next the top soil is removed and is usually also stored for replacement during rehabilitation.

## Minerals in Modern Technology — Google Arts & Culture
For example bauxite (aluminum oxide, hydrate) is an ore of aluminium. After they are mined, ores are purified into individual minerals or metals through a series of concentrating, smelting and refining processes.  Australia is ranked number one in the world for iron resources and is one of the largest producers of iron ore in the world
