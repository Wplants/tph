Hematite is a grounding stone that is mostly used for protection and stability. The word "hematite" is derived from a Greek word that means "blood." As a result, it is known as the "bloodstone" and has been employed as a talisman against excessive blood flow. Hematite is a kind of iron ore that is made up of iron oxide crystals.

## Hematite - Mining Fundamentals
Hematite can also occur as a result of volcanic activity. Clay-sized hematite crystals occur as a secondary mineral along with oxyhydroxides, such as goethite, or other iron oxides as a result of the weathering process in soil. The most common deposits of hematite are sedimentary deposits, such as the Lake Superior district in North America.
