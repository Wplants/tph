## Understanding How The Indian Cement Industry Works
Cement is basically is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials to 1450°C in a kiln. The resultant hard material which is recovered after heating limestone and chemicals is called 'Clinker'. Clinker looks like small lumps.

## Cement: Applications, Manufacturing Process, Types and Tests
Concrete is a combination of cement, sand or other fine aggregates, and a coarse aggregate ranging in size from 19 to 25 mm. People use concrete in a wide range of construction applications. Some applications of the different types of cement include: Plastering, masonry construction, pointing, and other purposes.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

This type of cement was invented in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin. It is named 'portland cement' because its property is similar to the stone quarried on the Ise of Portland, England. The making process of portland cement in the modern industry can be divided into the wet process, dry process, and semi-dry process.
