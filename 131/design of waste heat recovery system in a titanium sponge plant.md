## Waste Heat Recovery - DieselNet
Abstract: Waste heat recovery is the use of thermal energy that would otherwise be transferred to the environment to accomplish a useful function.Examples for internal combustion engines include the use of engine coolant for cabin heat, turbocharging to increase power density, bottoming cycles to produce additional work from exhaust gas, or integrated exhaust manifold to facilitate engine warm-up.

## Design of waste heat recovery system in a sponge iron plant
In the present work waste heat recovery system is designed to integrate the heat of waste gas in the sponge iron process. For this purpose a case study of typical sponge iron production process is considered. The waste gas from a sponge iron plant exits at a temperature of around C. A lot of sensible heat is lost with these gases.

Waste heat recovery is the collection of heat created as an undesired by-product of the operation of a piece of equipment or machinery to fill a desired purpose elsewhere. Waste heat recouping methods range from the simple to the complex. A common simple example is household water drain heat recovery. In this method, the heat going down a sink or shower drain is recovered by a copper pipe

## What Is A Waste Heat Recovery System? - 2022 Guide
A heat recovery system is made out of an exhaust gas boiler (or oil fired boiler), a turbine, and a steam turbine with an alternator. img source: gannett-cdn. Since the nature of these systems is to reuse already created exhaust gasses, it makes them very cost-effective in energy savings in both existing and newly implemented systems.
