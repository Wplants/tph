## flat elongated produce|Mining and Rock Technology
Coarse aggregate shape (flat and elongated) is an important issue in the highway industry. Elongated aggregates tend to break down during the asphalt emplacement process. Flat aggregates tend to lay flat, imparting anisotropic properties to the finished product. The new Superpave guidelines call for no more than 10% of coarse aggregates to have aspect ratios .

## Why should flaky and elongated aggregates not be used in concrete 
Answer (1 of 7): Why does flakey and elongated aggregate should restrict to use in concrete? We often refer to those particles as "corn flakes" and "french fries". They are difficult to compact. They therefore require a lot of cement paste, which is expensive, and also leads to an excessive dr
