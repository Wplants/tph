## How to Determine Which Welding Rod to Use | eHow
Arc welders use a variety of different electrodes, also referred to as welding rods. Choosing the right welding rod will determine the how easily the weld is performed, and how strong the weld will hold. If the wrong welding rod is chosen the weld might not work at all. Keep in mind welding takes time to learn, and even though the right rod may

Jul 31, 2022The most widely used welding rods are 7018, 7014, 6013, 6011, and 6010. For example, using a 6010 welding rod can determine the tensile strength by the first two numbers. This number is represented by the pound per square inch (psi). Multiplying 60 by 1000, you will get 60,000 (psi), which means this is the pressure that the weld can withstand.

## What Are Welding Electrodes (and What You Should Know)?
The rods used for MIG and stick welding are examples of consumable electrodes. They have filler material, which melts to create weld joints. TIG welding, on the other hand, employs non-consumable electrodes. These electrodes consist mostly of tungsten, which does not melt (unlike consumable electrodes) due to its high melting point.

## The Beginner's Guide to Different Types of Welding Rods & Electrodes 
The first two welding rod numbers stand for the tensile strength of the filler material. This is measured in thousands of pounds per square inch. For example, the Lincoln 7018 welding rod numbers show that the tensile strength is 70,000 psi. The third welding number shows the directions in which you can use the electrodes.

## Do Welding Rods Go Bad | Your Guide To Electrode Care
Cook the rods for 1-2 hours at Fahrenheit / 80-105 degrees then up to as high as 450 -500 Fahrenheit prior to welding to get the best results from the rods. This is not a practice that you would use in a professional coded welding situation on critical work.
