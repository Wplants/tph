## Blue Flames and the Largest Highly Acidic Lake in the World - Geology
Sulfur mining at Kawah Ijen has its hazards. The steep paths are dangerous, the sulfur gases are poisonous, and occasional gas releases or phreatic eruptions have killed many miners. Kawah Ijen Volcano is one of the few locations on Earth where sulfur is still produced by artisanal miners. Today, most of the world's sulfur is produced as a

Kawah Ijen in East Java, Indonesia, is the site of a traditional sulphur mining operation. The 2,600-meter-high volcano is topped with a large crater and a one-km-wide and about 200-meter-deep lake of sulfuric acid. The status level of the active volcano has been raised by the Indonesian government to 'vigilant' in July 2012 and is still in effect today. Residents and tourists have

The article describes the mining for sulfur that takes place inside of the Ijen volcano in Indonesia. The sulfur that workers get is used to make white sugar, matches, and fertilizer. The work is done at the rim of a crater lake that has formed, where the minors collect the yellow heaps of sulfur with very limited protective gear.
