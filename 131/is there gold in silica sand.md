## Gold Mine Tailings: A Potential Source of Silica Sand for Glass Making
Most gold mine tailings are composed mainly of industrial sand (i.e., silica) and silica sand is best described as a granular material that is composed of majorly quartz and trace amounts of coal, clay and other minerals . In some instances, it is referred to as either quartz or industrial sand and is widely applied in many engineering

## Sand - Density - Heat Capacity - Thermal Conductivity
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz.

## Silica - the Most Abundant Element in Sand and Soil
After oxygen, silica is the most abundant element in sand and soil, and is found mostly as silicon dioxide. In the soil, it helps seeds to germinate by breaking through their hard outer shell and, if soil lacks silica, very few seeds would sprout naturally. In biodynamics it is recognised as an essential mineral and is added to composts.
