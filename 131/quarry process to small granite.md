## Granite Quarrying | Learning Center | New Hampshire Folklife
At one time small quarries were common in southern New Hampshire, but today only larger sites produce enough stone to be worth the cost of operation.  Street curbing is the quarry's mainstay, and it cuts about 330,000 linear feet a year. A retail store at the quarry also sells granite benches, gate posts, birdbaths and palettes of split and

How Granite is Mined and Imported. Granite is found close to the surface, meaning it can be cut from shallow quarries. Small holes are drilled to get the shape of the desired block size (making it easier to transport). Explosives are placed into these holes to carefully create a blast that's just strong enough to separate the granite from the
