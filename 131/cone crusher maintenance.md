## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The post-primary crushing sector is largely divided into impact crushers for the processing of softer stone and cone crushers for the processing of harder, more abrasive stone. The advantages of both machines are well known. The impact crusher, for example, has a higher co-efficient of reduction, produces crushed material with an optimal cubic

## Failure to adequately maintain crushers comes at a high price
26 July 2017. Crushers operate at high power, force and capacity in order to produce the required materials. This puts a great deal of strain on the crusher and its wear parts, which operators must be aware of when carrying out maintenance. Failure to do so may have a high impact, both in terms of financial cost and potential loss of production.

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

Cone crusher is widely used in mine production due to its high crushing efficiency, low maintenance cost and large output capacity. Cone crushers are divided into spring cone crushers and hydraulic cone crushers, both of which can be used for the production of medium and fine crushing of high-hardness materials.

Schulz (Superior Industries) reminded E&MJ that maintenance issues can arise if a crusher is not specified correctly in the first place. Looking at cone crushers in particular, "the processing circuit should be engineered to provide the cone with choke-fed material, or enough material to keep the crusher full," he said.
