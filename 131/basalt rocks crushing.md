## Crush the right rock and spread it on farms to help soil and the 
One way to do that is to bring the CO 2 to the rockâ€”injecting compressed carbon dioxide into basalt bedrock, for example. But you can also bring the rock to the CO 2 by crushing basalt into powder and spreading it over land. The tremendous increase in surface area when you crush up bedrock allows those weathering reactions to go much, much faster.

Measure the length and width and depth of the area you need to fill. For example, your yard is 20' by 30' and you want to put in a 6" deep layer of topsoil. You would multiply: 20' x 30' x 0.5' (6" = half a foot). The total equals 300 cubic feet. There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, so divide 300 cubic feet by 27 = 11.11 cubic yards.
