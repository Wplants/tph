## Lignite
Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.

## name companies involved with mining of coal and lignite in nigeria
The environmental impacts of coal will act as a restraint on the coal, lignite, and anthracite mining market. Coal mining companies are using 3D mine visualizers to obtain a real-time digital model of a mine. A 3D mine visualizer generates a three-dimensional model of the mine layout and transfers it directly to the operator.
