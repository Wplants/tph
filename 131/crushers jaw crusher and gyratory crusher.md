## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Are Sized. Jaw crushers are sized based upon the dimensions of the top feed inlet (gape) or the dimensions of the jaws. For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width.
