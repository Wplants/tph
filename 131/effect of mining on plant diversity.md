##  Increasing species diversity on landscapes impacted by coal mining in 
Australian laws require mining companies to undertake rehabilitation to create a stable landscape and to ensure further land-use options after the life of the mine. Past minesite rehabilitation has focussed on rapid and economic plant establishment on hostile media (Bellairs, 1998; Bradshaw, 1998) to improve the characteristics of the substrate.

## Biodiversity and Mining: a problem that technology can solve?
The relationship between mining and biodiversity has been rocky since its beginning. Blockhead will be attending PDAC 2019 as it kicks off in Canada this weekend. PDAC will deal with current issues in the mining sector such as sustainability, data, diversity and technological change. One such focus is on biodiversity.

## How does mining affect biodiversity? + Example
The answer to this is a little complex and scientists still have much to learn about how mining affects biodiversity. When the mine is in use, whatever lived where that mine will obviously have been destroyed or will have relocated. Thus, local biodiversity will decrease while the mine is active. The overall biodiversity of the larger area may

Effects on plants. Mining can also have severe adverse effects on plants. Plants usually require a certain pH-level to grow. This pH-level is often altered through mining activities. Thus, many plants will no longer grow efficiently and will lose their fertility which may lead to the local extinction of some plant species.

However, differences in plant composition (the identity of the species present) may have large effects on ecosystem processes if the traits of one or a few species dominate ( 5 ). For example, if one species or group of species reduces soil nutrients to a lower level than do other species, then this species (or group) may dominate pools of

Diplodia tip blight caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr.) Dyko and B. Sutton is a serious threat to the health of natural secondary Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) forests. To explore the effect of plant diversity on Diplodia tip blight disease occurrence, the correlation between Diplodia tip blight in P. densiflora and plant diversity in various stand types and vertical

## effect of mining on plant diversity
Effects of soil substrate quality, microbial diversity and, - Know More. Plants affect soil directly and also indirectly by modifying the community of soil organisms, which in turn may affect soil formation Frouz et al, 2008 These effects of plants occur via two major pathways one pathway is associated with litter, and the other is associated with roots Wardle et al, 2004
