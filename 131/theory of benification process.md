## Process theories of motivation - Strategies For Managing Change
Process theories of motivation - Adam's Equity Theory . At a basic level, most people generally prefer to be in relationships where give and take are about equal. So if one person is getting too little from the relationship, then clearly they are going to be unhappy with this but it is also likely that the other person will also be feeling

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

## Content and Process Theories of Motivation - Phdessay
Process theories of motivation (also referred to as cognitive theories) focus on how behavior change occurs, or how a person comes to act in a different way. The theories center its attention on the cognitive processes underlying an individual's level of motivation. There is less emphasis on the specific factors (or content) that causes behavior.
