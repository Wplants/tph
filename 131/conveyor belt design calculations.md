## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

## Pipe Conveyor Design - Conveyor Dynamics Inc
Pipe Conveyor Design. In pipe conveyors, the belt is rolled into a tube. These conveyors can negotiate tight curves and keep the material isolated from the environment. Our engineers invented a special carcass construction that is used by leading belt manufacturers to ensure the pipe is stable in horizontal curves (US Patent USB2).
