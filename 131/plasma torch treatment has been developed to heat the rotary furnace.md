Aug 7, 2021Artwork: Although plasma recycling processes vary, most work in broadly this way. Raw waste is processed to remove any recyclable materials before being fed, with gas, to the plasma arc. This vaporizes the waste to produce syngas (which has to be scrubbed clean) and aggregate.

Tempering. Tempering is a process that is often used after a material has been quenched. A heat treatment furnace tempering a material would help to reduce the brittleness and remove any stresses caused by quenching. In this process, the steel is heated to a specific temperature and then cooled. If the material is heated to 300 - 750 o C
