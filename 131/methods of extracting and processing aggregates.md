## 10 Different Types of DNA Extraction Methods (Updated) - Genetic Education
Let's discuss 10 standard DNA extraction methods. Molecular genetic techniques highly rely on pure DNA or RNA. For example, techniques like PCR, sequencing, microarray, hybridization and restriction digestion require DNA. Studies demonstrate that pure DNA certainly warranties the success of the assay.
