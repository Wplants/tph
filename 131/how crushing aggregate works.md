## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
Concept and significance of the Aggregate crushing value test. The ' aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under

## Crushing plant
A Crushing plant is one-stop crushing installation, which can be used for rock crushing, garbage crushing, building materials crushing and other similar operations. Crushing plants may be either fixed or mobile. A crushing plant has different stations (primary, secondary, tertiary, ) where different crushing, selection and transport cycles are done in order to obtain different stone sizes

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - The Constructor
Aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the strength of the aggregate and it is used in construction of roads and pavements. Crushing value of aggregates indicates its strength. Lower crushing value is recommended for roads and pavements as it indicates a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life and a more

Aggregate crushers can crush and process construction waste into concrete sand and gravel aggregates that meet production requirements. Recycled sand and gravel aggregates have similar properties to natural sand and gravel, which can be sued to configure concrete or mortar or be used as raw materials for the production of bricks.

Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.
