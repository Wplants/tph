## Iron ore :: ArcelorMittal Liberia
DSO is a sintering fines material. It is sold to steel mills and used as a feedstock in the production of sintered iron ore, which in turn is used as a feedstock for iron-making blast furnaces. It is in the blast furnace that the iron ore is converted to liquid hot metal. Iron ores are oxides that are rich in iron content.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
