The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.
