Dec 12, 2020Fine aggregate Specific gravity or Specific gravity of sand is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of fine aggregate (sand) to the weight of an equal volume of water. The Fine aggregate Specific gravity is often considered to be 2.65. For road construction, fine aggregate has a wide range from about 2.5 -3.0 but on average 2.68.

The concrete fragments are crushed and the larger particles in the mixture are removed to make the mixture feasible for use. The concrete sand is used widely to level the base for layers, patios, and walking paths. The concrete sand usually consists of fine particles. So it is also used to fill up the voids between coarse aggregates.
