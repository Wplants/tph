## Indonesian Coal Quality and Coal Reserves - Global Energy Certification
Coal quality. Indonesian coals are generally low in ash and sulphur, but on account of their low rank, they have a high content of volatile matter and moisture. The run-of-mine coal does not generally require preparation and simple crushing and screening suffices to produce a marketable product. The coal has nil or minimal coking properties

## Moisture content of coal - Mining engineering - Eng-Tips
Moisture content of coal. I understand that the moisture content of coal is normalised by the wet weight of the material as opposed to the dry weight (dry weight is used to normalise for soils). What is the basis for this? I understand it has something to do with volume change. I suppose it makes calculating water content from wet weight easier.

Total Moisture Calculation. Furthermore, the total moisture value of coal can be calculated by the following formula: TM = ADL + RM (1-ADL/100) Where: TM = total moisture, % ar. ADL = air dry loss, % ar. RM = residual moisture, % ad. Total moisture is a very important parameter in coal.

Victorian brown coal is a cost effective fuel for power generation. It is very cheap to mine and low in sulphur and ash yield but the high moisture content and hence low calorific value result in high CO 2 emission intensity relative to bituminous coal. This high moisture has ensured that power stations are located adjacent to their mines to minimise handling, transportation and environmental

The water applied for dust control often increases the run-of-mine coal surface moisture content to a 5 to 7 pct level. With surface moisture at this level, coal preparation plant operators usually resort to wet cleaning methods to clean the fine coal because pneumatic methods are generally ineffective at this moisture level.

Moisture content: Changes in moisture content; i.e., the drying or wetting of coal, have obvious effects on spontaneous heating of coal. A small quantity assists oxidation slightly whilst large quantities of moisture prevent the heating, although, as in a surface stockpile reserve, drying and wetting of the coal speeds up the heating process.

The steam spins turbines to generate electricity. In Australia in 2017 coal was used to produce about 60% of the nation's electricity requirements. Using brown coal for power generation is problematic because of the high water content. It crumbles easily on exposure to the air which reduces its value as a fuel and requires specialised storage.

## Moisture in Coal, Coal Analysis, Kentucky Geological Survey, University 
Moisture content is an important parameter in coal analysis. It is needed for determining the calorific (heating) value and handling properties of a coal. The moisture value given for a proximate analysis is the moisture measured as mass lost from a sample under specified conditions after heating in a moisture oven to 104 to 110°C (ASTM method
