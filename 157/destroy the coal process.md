Global Warming. The methane released from coal beds adds to the gas concentration in the atmosphere that warms the planet, otherwise known as the greenhouse gases. Combined with deforestation and the recent devastation to sea life, the carbon-dioxide produced by coal fires is a huge problem. The carbon-dioxide per energy output of coal fires is

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
If coal is high in sulfur or other impurities, it is washed with a water or chemical bath, removing up to 40 percent of inorganic sulfur in the coal. Not all coal is prepared using the same process. High-sulfur coal commonly undergoes washing to meet environmental regulations, while low-sulfur coal is often crushed and resized without being washed.
