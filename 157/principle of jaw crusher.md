## Working Principle of Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h. Typically a mining haul truck will empty

## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work? | Oreflow
March 28, 2019 / in News. A jaw crusher is a large piece of equipment that's used in mine and ore processing plants to crush rocks. The equipment was first introduced back in 1858 by inventor Eli Whitey Black who primarily developed machinery used for crushing stone. From there, jaw crushers have seen plenty of action in the pit and quarry

## The working principle of jaw crusher - Mining Mobile Crushers and 
Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.
