Mar 17, 2021Magnetite or black sand mining is supposed to be banned in the Philippines, but Moncano explained that the extraction of the said mineral offshore is allowed. He said, "Mining in shoreline is prohibited but offshore mining is allowed. If it is at least 1,500 meters from the shoreline going out to the sea, it is allowed.".

The iron ore deposit of Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine islands, occurs as a surficial mantle over serpentinized ultrabasic rocks. The ore is lateritic in origin, having been derived by subaerial decomposition of the parent serpentine rock. The Surigao deposit resembles closely the lateritic iron ores of Mayari, Cuba.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Jan 22, 2022Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.
