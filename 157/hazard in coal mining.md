Respirable coal mine dust is a hazard in underground and surface coal mines and in coal-processing facilities. It is a mixed dust, consisting mostly of coal, but can also include silica, clay, limestone and other mineral dusts. The composition of coal mine dust varies with the coal seam, the composition of the surrounding strata and mining methods.

## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and

Mine Safety. Safety in Illinois Coal Mines. Protecting miners is a primary concern to the Illinois coal industry. With both surface and underground mining, the safety of the workers is considered essential to the operation of a mine. Coal mining can be a hazardous occupation, and unless special precautions are taken, injury or death may result.
