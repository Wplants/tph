Answer: Dear Esme, In fact, it is not that difficult to tell the difference. All three have different compositions, different surfaces, and different weights. Hematite is the heaviest of the three, because it is an iron-based stone. So, if you have a hematite, tourmaline and obsidian stone of roughly the same size, hematite will be the heaviest.
