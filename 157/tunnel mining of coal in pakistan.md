## Thar coal mining project - addressing Pakistan's rising energy needs 
Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) has undertaken the execution of mining operations for coal extraction in the Thar coalfield, Block II, as a means of tackling energy deficiency across Pakistan. The area has exploitable lignite coal reserves of 1.57 billion tons. SECMC has made several investments for this project, which include the

## Pakistan Coal Mine Accident Kills Eight
A gas explosion killed eight Pakistani coal mine workers in the country's remote southwest on Monday, an official said. The accident happened in Loralai district, nearly 600 kilometres (375 miles) southwest of Islamabad in the insurgency-torn province of Baluchistan, which is rich in gas, oil and mineral deposits.

2 days agoThe Tunnel affords visitors an opportunity to learn how anthracite coal is mined. It shows how a vein of coal lies between rock and strata; it has a gangway, manways, and chutes. Part of the Tunnel is timbered and part lies in solid rock and requires no timbering. Our guides are experienced miners who know mining thoroughly.

Bayueshan tunnel (BYS) is an important construction crossing over coal mine goaf. The underground mining subsidence has led the tunnel cracked seriously in three years after it was built. In order to evaluate the coal mine influence and future stability of the tunnels, probability integral method (PIM) was used to calculate the tunnel deformation.

## Coal mining in Pakistan
The coal is mainly used in brick kilns and other factories such as textile and cement. The width of the coal seams vary from 6 inches to 9 feet. On average 1000 coal mines operate with turnover of Rs.50 million daily. Duki is the best private mining valley in Pakistan. More than 50% of the labor is from Afghanistan .

The cargo is coal, anthracite coal to be exact, unique for its high luster, high carbon count, and low impurities. That was back in the early 1900s in the small Pennsylvania borough of Ashland at a place now known as Pioneer Tunnel Coal Mine. Nowadays the mine cars are filled instead with people; the children in those cars are on school field

Tunnels are generally grouped in four broad categories, depending on the material through which they pass: soft ground, consisting of soil and very weak rock; hard rock; soft rock, such as shale, chalk, and friable sandstone; and subaqueous. While these four broad types of ground condition require very different methods of excavation and ground support, nearly all tunneling operations

Xinwen coal area is one of the largest coalfields in Northern China that has been under production for a significant period of time. Most of the coal mines in this area have extended to a depth of almost 1000 m underground.Xiezhuang Coal Mine located in this area is the case study dealt with in this paper.Several development tunnels have been excavated in this mine to a depth of more than 1200 m.
