The compressive strength of the lime-replacement mortars was less than that of the cement-lime mortars although both had compressive strengths in excess of the 1800-psi minimum required by ASTM C 270's property specification. The flexural bond strength of the cement-lime mortars was 50% greater than that of the lime-replacement mortars.
