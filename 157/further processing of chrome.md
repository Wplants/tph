## Top 3 Chrome Ore Processing Methods that Get Higher Recovery Rate
Jul 22, 2022So, flotation equipment is required. (2) Due to the huge difference in the grain size of chromite rocks, we will use multi gravity separators, i.e. different combinations of jigs, shaking tables, spiral chutes to form a complex chrome processing flowsheet for a better recovery result. Equipment name: Shaking table. Granularity scope: .019-2mm.
