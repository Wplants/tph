## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores
Beneficiation of Iron Ores., 1753. These ores ca n be directly used in the production of iron and steel. All other ores need benefaction and certain processing before they are used in t he production of iron and steel.
