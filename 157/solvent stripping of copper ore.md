## Heap Leaching of Copper Ores - State of the Science
Heap leaching accounts for around 20% of the global production of copper. In heap leaching coarsely crushed ore particles are contacted with an aqueous lixiviant percolating through large packed beds (heaps) of the ore particles, with the loaded solution collected at the foot of the heap for metal recovery, solution make-up and recycle.

## Electrowinning copper from solvent extraction acid strip solution using 
Dilute solutions were used to minimize losses due t o absorption by the ore particles and copper was recovered from the organic extractant by acid stripping and electrowinning. The primary concern in this investigation was the electrowinning step of the proc e s s, and the remainder of the system was operated to provide the electrolyte
