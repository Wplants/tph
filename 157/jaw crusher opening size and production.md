## JAW CRUSHER SELECTION AND PERFORMANCE PRIDICTING - Kefid
Jaw crushers are most commonly defined by gape size, open and closed side sets, and capacity. There are a wide range of jaw crusher sizes for varying production and product size requirements. The plates of a jaw crusher are used to apply compressive forces that induce tensile stresses within particles, causing fracture.

As excessive wear can cause a 10-20% reduction in production, it is important to find the optimal time for the jaw turn or change in terms of cost and benefit. Again, with the same scenario with C130, we would have approximately a 70 stph reduction in production, in other words, a decrease of USD 4000 to 8000 in revenue for one day.
