## Cobalt Recovery by the Chlorination-Volatilization Method
The aim of the present article is to study the feasibility of cobalt recovery by the chlorination-volatilization method. The effects of different variables on the cobalt volatilization rate are investigated, including the flow rate, oxygen partial pressure, and water vapor content of the carrier gas, roasting time, and temperature.

## Geometallurgy of cobalt ores: A review - ScienceDirect
Jan 1, 2021Typical cobalt recovery through flotation of mixed ores is about 50-70% from the sulphide and 30-40% from the oxide minerals (Crundwell et al., 2011a, Tijsseling et al., 2019). In all cases, some additional reagents are added during the oxide flotation phase to reduce the volume of froth produced.

Abstract: In this study, recovery of cobalt from a copper flotation tailing (pyrite concentrate) by oxidative acid leaching was investigated. The as-received tailings (d80: 64 μm) contained 6407

## Flotation Machine Cobalt Recovery By Flotation
A low flotation recovery (92.6 cobalt remained in the tailings) of cobalt was probably due to the formation of nonfloatable cobalt spinels and silicates in the slag.Sep 30, 2021 The mineral composition of copper-cobalt ores is complex than that of copper sulfides, and it is also difficult to discard tailing efficiently in primary flotation

## Cobalt extraction
Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation precipitates cobalt powder with a purity of approximately 99.6%. Recovery from copper-cobalt oxide concentrates. The ore is comminuted and the cobalt rich oxides are separated by froth flotation. The cobalt-bearing concentrate is then mixed with lime and coal, and then melted in a reducing atmosphere.
