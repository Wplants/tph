## Dirty energy: Coal versus cars - Canada's National Observer
Oct 26, 2021Producing gasoline, however, adds around 24 per cent in extra emissions. That's eight times more upstream emissions than for coal. As a result, the full "wells-to-wheels" CO2 intensity for gasoline cars and trucks jumps up to around 1,600 gCO2/kWh — 50 per cent higher than coal power plants. In Canada, that gap is wider still.

## Making Diesel from Plastic - Beston Pyrolysis Plant
Simple description of making diesel from plastic waste: 1. Pump the plastic oil into distillation reactor; 2. Heat the oil in non-oxygen condition, and the oil will start boiling and evaporating gradually; 3. Through cooling pipe, the oil vapor will be condensed into liquid oil and another part of the vapor with shorter hydrocarbon lengths will

## What Makes Coal Valuable? 5 Things That Drives Its Price in 2022
Mar 22, 2022Uses of Coal. Description. Power Generation. Steam coal, also known as thermal coal, provides a source of electricity. Power plants ground steam coal into a powder and fire it into a boiler to produce heat. The heat is used to turn water into steam. The steam powers a turbine that, along with an alternator, generates electricity.

It is all about money in the short term. Coal has a limited supply based on 2018 data of recoverable reserves at producing mines, we have about 26 years based on current mining technology. Coal is still the primary source of energy production for power plants even though utilities are bringing in a more renewable mix. Once coal is gone it is gone.

Coal-to-Liquids. Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) is a process of converting coal to fuels such as diesel or gas.

Synfuels are used as an alternative to oil

## Synthetic Diesel Fuel
Abstract: Synthetic diesel fuels can be made from carbon containing feedstocks, such as natural gas or coal, in a process developed by Fischer and Tropsch in the 1920s.That process has been further developed by oil companies and is considered a viable option of natural gas utilization. Synthetic diesel fuels are characterized by excellent properties, such as very high cetane number and no

## Diesel production in coal-based high-temperature Fischer-Tropsch plants 
Gas-to-liquids (GTL) and also coal-to-liquids (CTL) Fischer-Tropsch plants using high-temperature (entrained flow) gasification all face the same refining challenge, which is meeting the EN590 density specifications of 820 kg m −3 at 15 °C for the produced distillate. Fischer-Tropsch distillates can, however, be blended with high density distillates originating from sources such as
