## The economic and social benefit of coal mining: the case of regional 
Oct 15, 2020This paper examines economic impacts of coal mining across local government areas (LGAs) in Australia. Three main distinguishing features of this research are a) the analysis through the mining boom and bust cycle, b) a focus on small regional areas within one state in Australia and c) the use of socio-economic indicators in addition to the standard income and employment indicators.

## Coal Industry in India - Economics Discussion
In 1884, only 68.9% of the coal consumed on Indian railways was of domestic origin. This proportion gradually rose till, in 1903, 99.2% was obtained from Indian collieries. Imports of coal declined from 8.4 lakh tons in 1894 to 1.9 lakh tons in 1903; exports, first begun in 1886, increased to 4.4 lakh tons in 1903.

The government of India has stipulated that, as of June 2016, power plants of capacity of 100 Megawatt (MW) or above, located 500 to 749 kilometres (km) from coal mine pit-heads must utilise raw, blended, or beneficiated coal with ash content of 34 percent or less. The obligation of meeting this target rests with the coal supplier.

In an open-pit mine or quarry, a drone survey refers to the use of a drone (or UAV - unmanned aerial vehicle) equipped with a downward-facing RGB camera to capture images of a site from different vantage points. Out of these images, a photogrammetry software can recreate geo-referenced 3D maps, contour lines digital terrain models or digital surface models of the mining site.
