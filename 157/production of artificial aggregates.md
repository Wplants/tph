Mar 13, 2022The production of aggregates from various industrial byproducts mainly undergoes the basic steps such as mixing of raw materials, agglomeration and binding or hardening of the fly as particles (Bijen 1986). Agglomeration means fine particles are joined together and form a colloidal system, which can be simply broken by mechanical forces.

## Artificial Aggregates | Scientific.Net
Abstract: Artificial aggregates (AAs) were manufactured from the acid clay (waste bentonite) and dredged soil produced at a thermal power plant by sintering at 600~1200Â°C for 10min. And those specimens were compared with respect to their bloating ability. The aggregates of acid clay had well-developed black core and uniform macro pores.
