What changed plant remains into coal? Coal originates as dense swampy forests. After the plants died the high water table protected many of the plant remains from decomposition. . Peat is soft and easily compressed but when it is buried deeply the water is squeezed out and the carbon rich substance is changed into coal. Do plants turn into coal?

## What created coal?
What created coal? Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years.Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.
