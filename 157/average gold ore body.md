## Calculation of Ore Tonnage & Grade from Drill hole Samples
The area influenced by any given hole is found as follows: (1) Divide angle at hole by 180Â°. (2) Multiply total area of entire prism by above result. (3) Multiply area found by (2) by the average thickness (found by solution of the formula) of ore in the hole, which thus transforms this smaller prism into volume.
