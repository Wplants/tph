Trivia. In real life, gold is one of the softest metals, but in Terraria (as lampshaded by the Goblin Tinkerer) it is harder than such heavy-duty metals as iron or steel.; Even though Gold and Platinum Ore (and Bars) are of nearly equal sell value, 1 Platinum Coin is worth 100 Gold Coins.This is likely because Platinum Ore and Bars were added after Platinum Coins, and also is a reflection to

## Calculation of Ore Tonnage & Grade from Drill hole Samples
The area influenced by any given hole is found as follows: (1) Divide angle at hole by 180°. (2) Multiply total area of entire prism by above result. (3) Multiply area found by (2) by the average thickness (found by solution of the formula) of ore in the hole, which thus transforms this smaller prism into volume.
