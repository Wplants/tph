Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm. Secondary jaw or cone crushers should be selected for hard and abrasive materials to maintain optimum operating costs.

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that

Ideally, the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusher. The feed size to a secondary crusher is typically in the range of 50 mm to 250 mm (up to 300 mm). If the capacity is higher, the acceptable feed size gets larger.

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that exist to

## Primary & secondary crusher in limestone processing plant
Both of these two primary crushers can crush stones with the compression strength below 320MPa. Secondary crusher usually processes the products of primary crusher and it can process the particles into smaller sizes. Secondary crusher can process materials with a harder strength, such as below 350Mpa.
