Put the wires back on the correct terminals and watch the spin cam bar as you start the washer in "spin." If the spin cam bar does not move, the wigwag is bad; replace it as described in section 3-11. Check also for a broken pin in the plunger. If the spin cam bar DOES move, the clutch is worn out; see section 3-15.

## What Are Smart Washers and How Do They Work? - Make Tech Easier
A smart washer gives you more control alongside convenient extras and notifies you when your laundry load is done. When you give a command from your smartphone or with your voice, the washer will lightly tumble your clothes every couple of minutes for air to flow through until it detects you've come back via the Wi-Fi link in your home.

## How Washer Dryer Combos Work | HowStuffWorks
When choosing between a separate washer and dryer or an all-in-one combination, there are some advantages and drawbacks that should be considered. One of the most obvious advantages of an all-in-one unit is the space savings. Since many of these units are about the size of a standard dishwasher and can fit under a countertop, they offer those with limited space a laundry option [source: Lee].
