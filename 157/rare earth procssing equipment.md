## Rare Earths Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart - JXSC
The rare earths, or rare earth elements (REE), are a relatively abundant group of elements consisting of scandium, yttrium, and the 15 elements of the lanthanide series of the periodic table. Scandium (Sc) is the lightest rare earth element. Scandium is present in crustal rocks in amounts greater than lead and precious metals, but it rarely
