## The Thin Coal Seam (TCS) Mining Technology for Open Pit Mines in China 
Coal seam that is thinner than a certain value is defined as thin coal seams (TCS). It commonly occurs in China as it covers 84.2% of the mining area. This situation is even severe in China's large surface coal mines, in which TCS accounts for 10-50% of the total reserve. Most TCS cannot be feasibly mined due to the working conditions of commonly used mining equipment. A tremendous of

## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

## Basics of an open pit mine - Mine Engineer.Com
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore. To mine metallurgical coal, which will later be turned into coke, it's usually necessary to sink vertical mine shafts to access coal which is deposited in layers or 'seams

## Open Pit Mining Techniques|Surface Mines|Rock or Mineral Extraction
Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.
