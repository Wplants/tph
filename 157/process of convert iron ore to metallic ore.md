## Iron ore
Iron is the world's most commonly used metalâ€”steel, of which iron ore is the key ingredient,  To convert it to metallic iron it must be smelted or sent through a direct reduction process to remove the oxygen. Oxygen-iron bonds are strong, and to remove the iron from the oxygen, a stronger elemental bond must be presented to attach to the

## How To Extract Metal From Ore? - Realonomics
Jan 13, 2022How To Extract Metal From Ore? Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore. Smelting usually requires a reduction agent or another chemical to separate metal from its ore. May 7 2011

## Extraction of Crude Metal from Concentrated Ore - Toppr-guides
This step will give us metal in its pure form i.e. the native form of metal. First, we must convert the ore to a suitable form. The metals need to be in an oxide form for the reduction process to be easier. Hence the ores are converted to oxides, so it is ideal for reduction. After doing so the ores will undergo reduction, to give us metal.

Herein, How can we convert an ore to a metal? This step will give us metal in its pure form i.e. the native form of metal. First, we must convert the ore to a suitable form. The metals need to be in an oxide form for the reduction process to be easier. Hence the ores are converted to oxides, so it is ideal for reduction.
