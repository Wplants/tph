## All About Concrete And Aggregate Equipment | Sepro
What About Concrete? Concrete is a mixture of cement, water and aggregates. Aggregates make up between 60 and 75 percent of the mix; cement and water make up the rest. The aggregate used can include sand, gravel, crushed stone, or recycled concrete. Different aggregates will be selected, depending on the application of the concrete.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Grading of Aggregates - Aggregate Grading - The Construction Civil
A little more sand makes the concrete more fluid without extra water. Too much of sand will increase porosity of the concrete and need more cement. Mixes having a larger coarse aggregate require less water and less cement. For concrete works to be water-roof, a dense mix should be aimed at with small size of aggregate.

## To Determine Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregate - Concrete Practical
Coarse aggregates are particles greater than 4.75mm, but generally range between 9.5mm to 37.5mm in diameter. They can either be from Primary, Secondary or Recycled sources. Primary, or 'virgin', aggregates are either Land- or Marine-Won. Gravel is a coarse marine-won aggregate; land-won coarse aggregates include gravel and crushed rock.

## Aggregate Moisture in Concrete - Concrete Construction
The absorption of the aggregate indicates the quantity of water which will be absorbed into the pore structure. Most commonly, aggregates will have a moisture content that is either below or above this absorption limit. When batching, it is of critical importance to account for this water.
