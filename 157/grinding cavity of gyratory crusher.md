## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The gyratory crusher can work continuously in a full cavity without a feeding device. It can directly feed materials to the gyratory crusher by multiple vehicles, so the production capacity is large ( t/h), the unit energy consumption is small, and the work is stable. The noise is small.
