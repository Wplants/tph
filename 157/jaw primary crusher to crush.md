## Jaw Crusher VS Gyratory Crusher - JXSCMACHINE
The gyratory crusher is taller than the jaw crusher, thus needs a high workshop design. Besides, gyratory crusher is heavy than jaw crusher, it's not convenient to move. Capacity. Gyratory crusher can work continuously, has high productivity and crushing ratio ( up to 6-9.5), working performance is very stable, light vibration.
