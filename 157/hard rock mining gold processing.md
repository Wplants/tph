## Hardrock Mining Techniques|Underground Mines|Minings Method
Underground mining (hard rock) Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals such as those containing metals like gold, copper, zinc, nickel and lead or gems such as diamonds. In contrast soft rock mining refers to excavation of softer minerals such as coal, or oil sands.

## Gold mining
Hard rock gold mining extracts gold encased in rock, rather than fragments in loose sediment, and produces most of the world's gold. Sometimes open-pit mining is used, such as at the Fort Knox Mine in central Alaska. Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open-pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in north eastern Nevada.

## Geology Of Hard Rock Gold Deposits - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold, which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits. The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct). Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000. For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80% pure gold. Alternatively, gold that is 100% pure is 24ct.

## Quick Guide to Hard Rock Mining | An Underground Miner
Jan 28, 2021Hard rock mining is a process that includes various techniques of excavating minerals from hard rock - especially those that contain metals such as silver, gold, iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel. This process also involves the same techniques while excavating large ore bodies containing gems such as rubies and diamonds.

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.
