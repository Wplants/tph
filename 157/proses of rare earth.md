## Rare Earth hypothesis
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity anywhere in the universe requires the coincidence of a large number of fortuitous circumstances, including, among others, a galactic habitable zone; a central star and planetary system having the requisite character (i.e. a circumstellar habitable zone); a terrestrial planet of the right mass; the advantage of one or

## Separation of Rare Earth Elements - American Chemical Society
The 17 rare earth elements, or lanthanides, consist of elements 21 (scandium), 39 (yttrium), and 57 (lanthanum) to 71 (lutetium). The rare earths were so named because of their low concentration in minerals which were scarce. However, some of the elements are not as rare as once thought. Today, the rare earths are important for their use in

Earth's climate is warming due to human activities. As Earth experiences a warming climate, we experience hotter air temperatures. The ocean does an excellent job of absorbing the extra heat from the atmosphere, delaying the full impact of global warming. The top few meters of the ocean store as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere. .

## Science of Rare Earth Elements | Science History Institute
The rare earth elements occur at very low concentrations in most massive rock formations, and sources of the rare earth elements have been found on every continent as well as on the ocean floor. The geological challenge is to find ores with sufficient concentrations of rare earths to make it economically feasible to mine and process them.

## A clean way to extract rare earth metals - Harvard John A. Paulson 
Rare earth metals — those 17 chemically similar elements at the bottom of the periodic table — are in almost every piece of technology we use from cell phones to wind turbines to electric cars.

A separation mechanism referred to as displacement chromatography is initiated by a retaining ion loaded onto a strong cation exchange resin (i.e., sulfonic resin) in a separation column. A solution of mixed REE (i.e., mixed-rare-earth band) is saturated on the sulfonic resin in another column called the loading column.

## Selective precipitation of rare earth and critical elements from acid 
The products of this process can be further purified through a closed circuit precipitation process or other hydrometallurgical separation processes (Vaziri Hassas et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2016). A thorough understanding of the mechanism, optimizing the process and determining the scale-up parameters require the study of the kinetic and

## Frontiers | Life-Cycle Assessment of the Production of Rare-Earth 
Rare-earth elements (REEs) are a group of 17 elements with similar chemical properties, including 15 in the lanthanide group, yttrium, and scandium. Due to their unique physical and chemical properties, REEs gain increasing importance in many new energy technologies and systems that contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion (e.g., wind turbine, electric vehicles
