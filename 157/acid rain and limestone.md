## Acid rain - Energy Education
After acid rain falls to the Earth, the effects depend on the type of rock and soil it encounters. Limestone is able to neutralize the acid content of the rain, while granitic bedrocks consisting of granite, quartz, and gneiss are not able to do so as easily.The bedrock in the northeastern regions of Figure 2 is dominated by these granitic rock-types and is overlain only by thin soil layers

A lake surrounded by granite rock is likely to suffer more damage from acid rain because the granite is composed of silicates and does not undergo any acid-base reaction. Therefore it will not buffer acid rain like limestone will. Granite's lack of reaction with acid also means that gravestone made of granite are going to last longer than those

## Limestone and Acid Rain - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Limestone is one familiar form of calcium carbonate. Acids in acid rain promote the dissolution of calcium carbonate by reacting with the carbonate anion. This produces a solution of bicarbonate. Because surface waters are in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide there is a constant concentration of carbonic acid, H 2 CO 3, in the water.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Aug 15, 2022Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Effects of Acid Rain. Acid rain does not directly affect human health because the acid present in the rain water is very dilute. Acid rain damages buildings, monuments and statues especially those made of limestone and marble as they contain large amounts of calcium carbonates. The calcium compounds react with the acid in the rain, damaging them.

As acid rain falls to the earth's surface, limestone rocks and limestone components in soil will react with the rain, neutralize the acid and dissolve. As the limestone dissolves, the rocks will wear away, becoming pitted with rounded edges. The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time.

## Passive Treatment Methods for Acid Water in Pennsylvania
Introduction Acid rain and acid mine drainage have polluted thousands of miles of Pennsylvania streams with acid water. Many different types of acid water treatment systems have been developed over the past 30 years to combat this problem.  The added limestone reacts with rain and snowmelt water moving through the soil to make it less acidic

When sulfurous, sulfuric, and nitric acids in polluted air and rain react with the calcite in marble and limestone, the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues, we see roughened surfaces, removal of material, and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive.

We can see from this government report that both limestone and marble are affected by the problem of acid rain. Both limestone and marble tend to react with acidic substances by forming a gray or black crust of gypsum crystals. Thus, we can safely assume that acidic substances will stain both of these stones.

## When Acid Rain Falls On Limestone What Weathering Occurs - Realonomics
Feb 28, 2022What type of chemical weathering affects limestone? Limestone is chemically weathered by a process of carbonation. As rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere it becomes a weak carbonic acid. The water and carbon dioxide combine to form a weak carbonic acid. This weak carbonic acid acts on the fissures in the limestone.

## Why Is Water Acidic When It Reaches A Limestone Layer
Feb 2, 2022How does limestone affect acidity? Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate which is a basic substance. When it interacts with acidic waters the basic calcium carbonate can react with the excess acids and neutralize the water. In areas prone to acid rain the concentration of acids may be too much to be completely neutralized.

Effects of Air Pollution: Acid Rain - Acidification. Acid rain refers to any precipitation (rain, fog, mist, snow) that is more acidic than normal ( pH of less than 5.6. pH below 7 is acidic). Acid rain is caused by atmospheric pollution from acidic gases such as sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emitted from the burning of fossil fuels.
