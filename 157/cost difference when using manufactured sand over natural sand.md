## M Sand (Manufactured Sand) - A Substitute to River Sand
Overall, M Sand is 30% cheaper than the river sand. Eco-friendly: Use of M Sand in replacing with river sand avoids environmental disasters like groundwater depletion, water scarcity, a threat to natural life etc. Growing concern for environmental protection, M Sand is the best alternative to the river sand.

## Use of Manufactured Sand in Concrete and Construction An Alternate to 
The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.

The technology used: Use of modern and more advanced equipment is needed in order to produce quality sand. This adds to the cost of production. 3. Workability issues: M-sand may have a coarser and angular texture compared to natural sand which is smooth. This makes you use more water and cement to achieve the required workability.

sand acquired from waterway beds has been utilized primarily in the process of fine aggregate in the production of concrete. Because the supply of River sand is insufficient and its continuous supply is uncertain, use of Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) and Quarry Dust Sand as a substitute for Natural Sand has been inevitable.
