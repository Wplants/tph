## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.
