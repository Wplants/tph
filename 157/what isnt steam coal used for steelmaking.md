## PCI coal for steelmaking the first metallurgical coal grade to  - IEEFA
May 10, 2022The replacement of pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal with hydrogen in blast furnaces looks like being an early decarbonising application. Lower-cost PCI coal is injected into blast furnaces to reduce coking coal consumption. Essentially high-quality thermal coal, PCI coal can be sold into either the metallurgical or thermal coal markets.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking has played a crucial role in the development of ancient, medieval, and modern technological societies. Early processes of steel making were made during the classical era in Ancient Iran, Ancient China, India, and Rome.. Cast iron is a hard, brittle material that is difficult to work, whereas steel is malleable, relatively easily formed and a versatile material.
