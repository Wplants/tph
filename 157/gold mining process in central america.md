So, in 1852, Edward E. Mattison, a native of Connecticut, invented the process of hydraulic mining, in which a stream of water was directed under heavy pressure against a bank or hillside containing placer gold, and the earth was torn down by the fluid and carried into the sluice to be washed.

## gold processing | Britannica
By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.

## Gold Panning -History of a Prospecting Method (Tool)
There is a very long history of gold panning and gold placer mining in North America. The low cost of panning and its simple process allowed for many men of very modest means to join the gold rushes in North America in the 19th century. The first major rush in North America occurred from 1848 and 1855 in north central California.

A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold. This process does not result in gold that is 100% pure, but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.
