Installing a crushed limestone driveway can set homeowners back by about $1.25 to $2 per square foot of driveway space. A 16×48 foot crushed limestone driveway can cost between $960 and $1,536. A smaller driveway may only require a budget of $300 to $350, while a longer and larger driveway may require up to $60,000 in budget.

## Practical Considerations Related to the Use of Alternative Backfill 
Backfill and underlying foundation must be relatively free draining to allow rapid drainage of any water that accumulates in the backfill;  The larger 3/4-inch material is commonly supplied as crushed limestone and is typically angular in particle shape, which promotes the interlocking of particles and helps to confine the pipe walls.

## Bedding Pipe with Open Graded Crushed Limestone
Crushed limestone is used extensively for bedding underground pipe. Typically aggregate with a top size from 1 ¼" to 3/8" is used.  Another advantage that limestone bedding has over backfilling with clay is that limestone bedding does not expand or contract like clay, which can stress the pipe and eventually cause a break in the line.
