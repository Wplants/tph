## There is Big Silica Sand Demand In The World — The Next 'Lithium'?
Feb 9, 2021The Demand for Silica Sand. This all sounds rather benign too until you get into the nitty-gritty. Sand mining all over the world has led to environmental destruction and organised crime. Sand supplies are big but so is the demand. Think of all those skyscrapers going up in the Middle East and Asia.

The iron sand primarily contains silica (SiO2) and iron, which have been combined to form a chemically stable, glass-like compound. The iron comes from the copper mineral and the silica is bought in the form of sand used to form slag during the smelter's processes. The iron sand also contains small amounts of copper (0.5%) and zinc (1.2%).

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.

## Silica sand mining | Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
Silica sand mining. Southeastern and south central Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin have extensive deposits of sand that meets the specifications required for hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," a drilling method used for natural gas and oil wells. Mining of these deposits has been occurring in the region for many years, however recent

## Ironsand
Ironsand, also known as iron-sand or iron sand, is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe 3 O 4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium.. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.
