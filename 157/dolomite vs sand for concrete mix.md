## Agricultural Limestone vs Dolomite - Braen Stone
Pros - Like aglime, dolomite is able to very effectively raise soil pH. At the same time, it's able to correct soil with a magnesium deficiency. For optimum health, sandy soil should have a calcium to magnesium ratio of 7:1 for sandy soil and 10:1 for clay-based soil. Cons - Dolomitic lime shouldn't be applied where it isn't needed.
