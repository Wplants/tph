## Production Aluminium Sulphate [(Al2(SO4)3] from Kaolin Jaboi Sabang by 
One of the main chemicals used in water treatment process are aluminum sulphate used as coagulant thus forming clean water. Aluminum sulfate [Al2(SO4)3] or alum is one of the chemicals that are required both in industry and water treatment companies. This research objective was to study the operating conditions of the process of making solid aluminum sulfate of kaolin and sulfuric acid to see

## automatization of aluminium sulfate production process
Aluminum sulfate production The most important and the most valuable process developed by Dabster is the production of aluminum sulfate from various raw materials Dabster owns the technology and knowhow to produce aluminum sulphate from such raw materials like kaolin, bauxite and aluminum hydroxide.
