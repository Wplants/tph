## Gold extraction
A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes.  According to de Lecerda and Salomons (1997) mercury was first in use for extraction at about 1000 BC, according to

## mercury processing - Extraction and refining | Britannica
The pyrometallurgical extraction of mercury from its ore is essentially a distillation process. When heat is applied to the sulfide ore in the presence of air, oxygen combines with the sulfur to form sulfur dioxide, and the metal is liberated at a temperature above its boiling point. The gases are then passed through a series of U-shaped tubes to condense the mercury vapour to the liquid phase.

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury

Mercury readily forms alloys with other metals, and this makes it useful in processing gold and silver.

It is a process that works best for processing complex ore types, especially ores that are difficult to process using gravity methods. In flotation, a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.
