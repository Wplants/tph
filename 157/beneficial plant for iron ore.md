## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Iron Ore Beneficiation Process. During the last ten years great strides have been made, on the Mesabi range, in the practice of beneficiating low grade iron ore material. By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being
