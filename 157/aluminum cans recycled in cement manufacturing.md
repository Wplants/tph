## What's Holding Back Aluminum Recycling in the US | BCG
May 10, 2022About half of all used aluminum beverage cans in the US were recycled in 2020. This puts the country far behind Germany, for example, where the recycling rate—determined by the materials collected for recycling as a percentage of the total materials generated for recycling—for cans was 99%. And while about 80% of the weight of a car or

## Aluminum Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
A common practice since the early 1900s, aluminum recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when recycling of aluminum beverage cans finally vaulted recycling into the public consciousness. Sources for recycled aluminum include automobiles, windows and doors, appliances, and other products.

## Aluminum Beverage Can Manufacturing With NESTEC Air Emission Control 
Apr 8, 2021With state-of-the-art furnaces in place accepting only used beverage cans (UBCs) that meet high-quality standards, total metal losses in the recycling process are limited to 2%, mainly due to oxidation. When factoring in the recycling rate and the material losses in recycling, it is clear that the recycling yields of the aluminum recycling

## How aluminum beverage can is made - material, production process 
The major expense of the beverage can is in the energy needed to produce the aluminum, but recycling can save up to 95% of the energy cost. Can producers also try to control waste by developing stronger can sheet so that less aluminum goes into each can, and by carefully controlling the manufacturing process to cut down on loss through earing

Recycling a single can saves 1.56 megajoules (MJ) of energy or 98.7 grams of CO2 equivalent. This means that recycling just a 12-pack of aluminum cans will save enough energy to power a typical passenger car for more than three miles. The energy saved by recycling 100% of aluminum cans in the U.S. could power up to 4.1 million homes for a full year.

Although aluminum cans are recyclable, the Container Recycling Institute notes that approximately half of all aluminum cans end up in incinerators or landfills--resulting in the need for additional cans made from new materials. Aluminum smelting gives off sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, which can result in both smog and acid rain.

Melting the Aluminum. The first step you'll want to take is to crush the cans so that you can load as many as possible into the crucible. You'll get about 1 pound of aluminum for every 40 cans. Load your cans into the container you're using as a crucible and place the crucible inside the kiln. Close the lid. Fire up the kiln or furnace to 1220°F.

## Is recycling aluminum cans worth it? | updated September 2022
Of course it is! For every ton of used aluminum we recycle, we save 1,500 kilos of iron ore and about 500 kilos of coal. Moreover, by producing aluminum from scrap we save 95% of the energy that would be needed to produce it from the primary mineral, bauxite. In short, aluminum is the second most widely used metal in the world and demand for it

The aluminum can is the consumer product that is recycled the most. The aluminum industry pays out a total of $800 million dollars for empty aluminum cans each year. This money goes to organizations such as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, local schools, and Habitat for Humanity. The money obtained from recycling goes right back into the community.
