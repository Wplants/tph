## How Is Limestone Extracted - Realonomics
Jan 13, 2022How does limestone get extracted? Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining. . The basic elements of surface mining are overburden removal drilling blasting and hauling ore to the crushing and processing plant.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation - Sepro Labs
Most rock deposits contain metals or minerals, but when the concentration of valuable minerals or metals is too low to justify mining, it is considered a waste or gangue material. Within an ore body, valuable minerals are surrounded by gangue and it is the primary function of mineral processing, to liberate and concentrate those valuable minerals.

Lime is a mineral made by heating limestone or dolomite in a kiln. Lime is used in a variety of chemical industries, in sugar processing plants, in steel mills, sewage treatment plants, and at paper mills. "Burned" or kilned limestone was also used as plaster and mortar in the homes of early settlers, and even into the mid-20th century.

The word mining sounds a lot like mineral, and that's not a coincidence because mining is how minerals are removed from the ground. There are different ways by which minerals are extracted from the ground, but the two main methods are called surface mining and subsurface mining. Surface mining is done on the surface where the ores are located.
