The chemical reaction between a dilute cyanide solution and zinc will separate the gold from the ore. 3 Use a filter press to remove the gold from the solution.

## Part Processed Gold Ore
What is Gold Ore worth? High Grade Mining Ore. A single piece of gold ore generally has very little actual gold content. Although a very rich ore may have some visible gold present, the vast majority do not actually have any visible gold present, and only crushing and processing of the ore will release the gold within to host material.

The first stage of processing gold ore is crushing. The gold then needs to be separated from the resultant powder. Coarse gold may be removed by gravity concentration. The powder is mixed with water, the gold sinks and the other wastes are washed away. Fine gold in crushed ore will be processed differently depending on the nature of the gold

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

Now understand this bigger rock weighs (20 pounds plus) so that means there's more than 10 pounds of gold inside that rock. At a 50% average so 10 Troy pounds gives 120 ounces of gold in the rock and assuming it's at $1500 an ounce. We get something around $180,000 for minimum value from that, by multiplying 120 ounces times $1500 an ounce.
