## Secondary & Tertiary Crushing Circuits - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The feed comes from the primary crusher and will have a certain amount of rock that doesn't need further crushing. To run this ore through the crusher will be a waste of energy and crushing space.  the cone crusher. Within a secondary and tertiary crushing circuit there are three main types of machinery, CONVEYORS, CRUSHERS, and SIZING
