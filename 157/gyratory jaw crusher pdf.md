This, plus point 1, give the jaw a definite advantage over the gyratory, except in the very large sizes, for handling rock of massive formation. The jaw crusher is more easily adjusted, to compensate for wear of liners.

The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher, the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore, primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.
