## BROKEN ARROW ROCK SHOP - 20 Reviews - Arts & Crafts - Yelp
20 reviews of Broken Arrow Rock Shop "The best little rock shop in Texas. I collect semi-precious stones and specimens and I really have to say that the owner (Dan) is the man. This is a quaint little place tucked away behind the other shops on the courtyard mall. Worth looking for, great prices on great pieces. Dan does his homework and brings the best deals to his store.
