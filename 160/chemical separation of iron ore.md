## Concentration of Ore - Definition, Methods of Separation, Examples
Nov 28, 2021We achieve a concentrated ore with a high percentage of metal by eliminating these impurities. The concentration of ore, also known as ore enrichment, is the process of removing gangue particles from ore in order to enhance the percentage of metal in the ore. The difference in physical or chemical properties of the ore and the impurities

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

Jan 1, 2022Reduction of Hunan iron ore containing 47.3% Fe and 1.59% P with coal at 800°C for 25 min, followed by a magnetic separation, produced a concentrate with 0.81% P. Leaching the concentrate at 30 wt% solids for 2 h with sulfuric acid lowered the phosphorus content to 0.20% P for an acid consumption of 50 kg/t ore.

## Iron Ore: Mineralogy, Processing and Environmental Sustainability 
Iron Ore: Mineralogy, Processing and Environmental Issues summarizes recent, key research on the characterization of iron ores, including important topics such as beneficiation (separation and refining), agglomeration (e.g., production of pellets or powders), blast furnace technology for smelting, and environmental issues relating to its production.

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
In addition to kaolinite, gibbsite, of general chemical formula Al(OH) 3, is also a common alumina containing mineral in iron ore. Separation of gibbsite from iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite is known to be extremely difficult due to the similarities in their surface properties.
