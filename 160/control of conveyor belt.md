## Common Conveyor Belt Problems and their solutions - Gough Econ, Inc.
If the belt is too loose, it will slip, and it may not move properly. Because the rollers cannot maintain a tight connection with the belt, the conveyor belt might start, stop, and just function poorly, as if it has a mind of its own. The belt will also drift from side to side, which can cause wear damage to the belt and the rollers.
