Unlike a sand substrate, gravel doesn't need additional prep before cleaning. The higher weight and surface area make everything a lot easier. Maintaining this substrate is as easy as straight-up vacuuming it once every 1-2 weeks. Just as with sand, a gravel substrate benefits from good water flow.
