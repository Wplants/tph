## Gold Mining in South Africa | Africa Mining IQ - ProjectsIQ
In 1975, South Africa was responsible for producing 40% of the gold ever mined. By 2010, however, China affirmed its status as the world's largest gold producer with production of 324 tonnes of gold, followed by Australia (222.8 tonnes), and South Africa with 219.8 tonnes. Today, South Africa produces only 4.2% of the world's gold.

In 2002, surface water in South African lakes had 40,000 times the natural level of uranium in freshwater, and this is still a problem today 4. With uranium exposure so high, people are prone to kidney disease and cancer 5.
