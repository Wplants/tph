The requirements for both water absorption and saturation coefficient can be waived if the units pass the freezing and thawing test described in ASTM C 67. Minimum compressive strength values also are set for durability. SW units must have a minimum average strength of 3000 psi with all units greater than 2500 psi.

## Predicting the compressive strength of unreinforced brick masonry using 
This study analysed the applicability of three machine learning techniques as alternative methods for predicting the compressive strength of masonry constructions. A database was established by performing experimental testing on 44 masonry specimens.  matched well with values obtained by experimental testing. Also, the compressive strength

## Torsion test of mild steelurchfo
Ultimate tensile strength of Mild Steel is between 400 - 550 MPa. The ultimate tensile strength is the maximum on the engineering stress-strain curve. This corresponds to the maximum stress that can be sustained by a structure in tension. Ultimate tensile strength is often shortened to "tensile strength" or even to "the ultimate.".
