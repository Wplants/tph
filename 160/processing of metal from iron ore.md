## The 6 Steps To Modern Steel Production Explained - Metro Steel
Step 1 - The iron making process. As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made. Iron ore, lime, and coke are placed into a blast furnace and melted. The resulting liquid known as molten iron is then formed. As molten iron still contains around 4% - 4.5% impurities such as carbon which in turn make the metal brittle

## Steel production: from iron ore to functional industrial products. - Vepica
How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.

Making steel. Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route. Both processes are being continually improved

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Ancient Metallurgy - University of California, San Diego
Metallurgy is the process of working metal into artifacts (tools and toys). Although small amounts of metals are found in relatively pure form, most must be extracted from more complex ores by removing the "impurities" (non-metal or other metal) from the combination ore.  It is easy to think of steel as iron ore to which carbon is added,

##  Primary Metal Production - Michigan Technological University
Molten metals tend to dissolve impurities from the ore. For example, many ores that contain native copper have arsenic compounds associated with them. When the ore is melted, the molten copper dissolves the arsenic. As a result, the metal from the furnace can be less pure than the individual metal grains that were originally in the ground.

Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

2019. 1. 1. · Primary Steel Making. Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore, coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace. The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4-4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
