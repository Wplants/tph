For concrete, the procedure for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. You need to divide the total cubic yards that the yield needs to determine the number of concrete bags you need. Use the following yields per each bag size: 40-pound bag yields .011 cubic yards. 60-pound bag yields .017 cubic yards.

The formula is in feet and is L x W x H (/27). This formula will give you the estimated cubic yardage needed to do your project. For example if you have a concrete slab 24' L x 24' W x 6" thick, the formula would read like this; 24 x 24 = 576 x .5 = 288 divided by 27 = 10.67 cubic yards. (make sure you change the inches thick to feet, 6 inches
