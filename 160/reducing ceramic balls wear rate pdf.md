Some of the Ceramic Ball Bearings Conclusion Ceramic ball is tremendously harder than steel (Rockwell 78c versus Rockwell 60c for steel balls). Ceramic ball is 60% lighter than a steel ball. Ceramic ball is much less prone to "skid". Ceramic ball is significantly rounder and has a finer finish than conventional steel balls.

## Ceramic Balls Smoothness And Hardness Wear Strength Alumina Zirconia 
The increased hardness of the ceramic ball means that the contact area between the ball and the track is reduced, which leads to lower friction, higher potential speeds and less energy wasted. The hardness and extremely smooth surface also means that the balls are far more durable than steel balls. Specification: 1.
