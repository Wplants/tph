## Phosphate Rock Mining - JXSC Mining
The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.

But that didn't spell the end of phosphate; in the mid-19th century the British began mining phosphate rock, and in the following decades it took over as the primary source to produce fertilizer. Today, phosphate is the key ingredient in modern agriculture. Indeed, it could be argued that phosphates make modern plantation systems possible.
