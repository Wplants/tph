As the pressure of the reactants increase, so does the reaction rate. The higher the pressure, the more particles of gas per unit volume. Therefore there are more collisions per unit time. The number of successful collisions per unit time will be higher and so the rate of the reaction will be faster. Video: 27TQ.
