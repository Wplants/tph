3. Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.

Manufacturing of cement is a very critical process because there are more than 25 types of cement. It begins with mining, grinding of material, and then passes through the kiln at 1450° C which is very high temperature and then gypsum is added with it. Cement is used in different types of concrete, but the most commonly used cement is Portland

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

Modern dry-process cement plants with an efficient grinding and pyro processing system, typically consume less than 700 kcal/kg-cl of thermal energy and 100 kWh/mt of electrical energy. Older plants with inefficient systems, combined with operational and maintenance failure, tend to have much higher energy consumption.
