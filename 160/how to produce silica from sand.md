Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

Abstract. In the industry, sodium carbonate is used to prepare sodium silicate; however, this process generates great volumes of CO 2. In this work, sodium hydroxide has been proposed to prepare sodium silicate using natural sand. Two experimental variables were considered, sodium hydroxide concentration and temperature to prepare sodium silicate.
