## Lime powder silo measurement: overcoming dust generation and product 
As a fine grain material, lime powder is typically stored in silos up to 25m and survives process temperatures between -40C and 50C. When choosing process instrumentation, operators must consider the challenges associated with storing lime powder. The two most common issues that occur are extreme dust generation and product build-up.

## Pressing And Sintering Of Powder Parts - Manufacturing Process
Powder Sintering . Powder sintering involves raising the temperature of the green compact, (pressed powder part), to a certain level and keeping it at that temperature for a certain amount of time. The sintering temperature is usually between 70% and 90% of the melting point of the powder metal. This will cause bonding mechanisms to occur between powder particles pressed together in the compact.
