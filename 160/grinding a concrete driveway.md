Create a smooth surface by slightly sloping the concrete back from the lip or edge of the crack. Use a dry hand grinder to smooth off the surface.

## concrete - Is it normal to use a grinder to finish a new driveway 
Ordinary concrete mixes or cement cannot be used as an "overlay" or skim coat as it requires much thickness for strength. Specialty modified cement mixes, in pails or pumped, are required to obtain adhesion and compressive strength in thin overlays. These are expensive. Grinding concrete requires diamond wheels and is laughable in this situation.
