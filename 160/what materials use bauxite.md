## Bauxite: Definition, Formula, Types and Different Applications
Bauxite is a material that occurs naturally and is heterogeneous in nature. It is composed primarily of one or more aluminium hydroxide minerals, along with various mixtures of silica, iron oxide, titania, aluminosilicate, and other impurities in traces. Bauxite, despite being often considered a mineral, is actually a rock.

##  Opportunities for use of bauxite residue in special cements
Work on the use of bauxite residue in cement has been pursued for over 80 years with many successful technical studies and several large‐scale initiatives which has led to industrial usage of bauxite residue at a number of Portland cement clinker production plants. The driving force behind

## What are uses of bauxite? Definition, Types and Importance - AESL
Bauxite, together with alumina, is used in the production of aluminium compounds, including alumina. The raw material is used in refractories to make a variety of goods. It is used in the manufacture of aeroplanes, electric motors, machines, and civil tooling. Desiccating agents, catalysts, and adsorbents are other uses for it.

## Global Use of Bauxite and Bauxite Reserves Left to Human
Aug 20, 2022Bauxite is the primary raw material for the commercial production of alumina (Al 2 O 3) and metallic aluminum. Due to the excellent properties of aluminum, it is widely used in construction, transportation, foil packaging, electronics, machinery and equipment, and consumer goods .
