## The Manufacturing Basics of Aluminium - BA Systems
MANUFACTURING PROCESS. 1. Bauxite Mining. Bauxite is used as the main raw material in the manufacture of aluminium. It is a clay mineral found in tropical and sub-tropical areas such as Australia and the West Indies. The bauxite is often mined from only a few metres below the ground level. About 4-5 tonnes of bauxites are required for 1 tonne
