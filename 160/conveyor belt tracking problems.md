## Conveyor Belt Tracking: Best Practices & Methodology
One of the most common issues that impacts conveyor operation is belt misalignment and tracking problems. Belt tracking issues occur when the conveyor belt does not run true on the conveyor frame, causing it to drift to one side or the other. This can result in the belt fraying, which will eventually lead to premature belt failure.
