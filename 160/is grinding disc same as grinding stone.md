## The difference between a diamond grinding disc and a grinding disc?
The biggest difference is the abrasive particles locked inside the bond pad. No diamond was found in a conventional diamond grinding disc. No, this is a mass of evenly dispersed alumina particles. The series has a wide range of gravel substitutes, of which zirconia alumina and ceramic alumina are among the best in steel alloy grinding materials.
