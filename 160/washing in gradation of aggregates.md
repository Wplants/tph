## What is combined aggregate gradation? - Heimduo
A. Combined fine and coarse aggregates grading is specified to ensure that a satisfactory amount of aggregate with a minimum amount of void spaces is obtained. This will enable the use of a minimum amount of paste (water and cementitious material) in concrete, improving the dimensional stability and the durability.

## Fun Fact Friday: The Aggregate 200 Wash - Encorus
Today, we discuss the aggregate 200 wash. Sieve analysis, or gradation testing, is a way to assess the particle size distribution of material. The aggregate material is put through a series of progressively smaller sieves, and the amount "caught" at each sieve size is weighed as a fraction of the material's whole mass.

## washing in gradation of aggregates
The particle size distribution of an aggregate as determined by sieve analysis is termed as gradation of aggregates. If all the particles of an aggregate are of uniform size, the compacted mass will contain more voids whereas aggregate comprising particles of various sizes will give a mass with lesser voids.The particle size distribution of a
