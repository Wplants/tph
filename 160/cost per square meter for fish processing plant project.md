## - SA BAUHAUS Building costs in 2019 South Africa.
In 2022, building costs for a new house can be anything from R12 000 to R17 000 a square meter (high spec can easily go to R25 000 and beyond). This price is calculated by adding all final build costs (excluding professional services and admin fees) and dividing the total by the house size in square meters. Naturally this is a guide only, but

This reduces cost per ton of output by 12 to 20 percent. Total costs range from $3.93 per ton in the 50-ton plant to $13.18 per ton in the 6-ton model. Practically all savings by the two-shift operations are due to reduced fixed costs. Operations with pelleting or bagging operations tend to have smaller savings with the increased hours of

## Costing out a cabling system | Cabling Installation & Maintenance
The baseline square-foot costs will also vary for a new building versus retrofit, or re-cabled, installation. To arrive at a square-foot ballpark figure, simply multiply the basic square-foot cost, say $10 per square foot, by the total system area; for example: $10x100,000 sq. ft. = $1,000,000. A square-foot cost is in no way a final cost, but
