Having your own gravel can really save a lot of money. Dry bags of portland cement costs about $5 a bag and it takes 5 of them to make a cubic yard. Do the math on that and you end up with $25 a yard. Considering pre-mixed concrete costs me $90 a cubic yard here and you can see a cement mixer quickly pays for itself.

Beneficiation of Iron Ores., 1753. These ores ca n be directly used in the production of iron and steel. All other ores need benefaction and certain processing before they are used in t he production of iron and steel. Low grade iron ores cannot be used as such for the production of iron and SST eel and need to be upgraded to reduce its gangue
