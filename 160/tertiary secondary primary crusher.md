## Tertiary Crusher
Tertiary crushers are machines that take part after the primary phase "primary crushers" and secondary phase "secondary crushers". Beside the question of "what is tertiary crusher?", working principle of crusher should be explained too. It works with the principle of applying high speed impact effect to the material.

## difference in primary and secondary crushing
The output of the primary crusher is fed to a secondary crusher, which further reduces the size of the material. similarly the output of secondary crusher is fed to the tertiary crusher which reduces the material size further. some of the materials may pass through four or more of the crushing stages before it is reduced to the desired size.
