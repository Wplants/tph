## Name the method used for refining of copper metal. - Vedantu
Complete answer: The method used for refining of copper metal is electrolytic refining. During electrolytic refining of copper, the anode is the positive electrode and is made from impure copper blocks. The electrolyte is a mixture of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid. The negative electrode is cathode. It is made from pure copper.

## Gold parting
The very earliest attempts at refining gold can be shown by the surface enhancement of gold rings. Gold quality was increased at the surface by 80-95% gold compared to 64-75% gold at the interior found in Nahal Qanah Cave dated to the 4th millennium BC.  Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## What is Meant by Refining of a Metal? Name the Most Widely Used Method 
The most widely used method for the refining of impure metals obtained by various reduction processes is electrolytic refining method. Electrolytic refining is a process of purification by electrolysis. Several metals like copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, chromium, gold and silver are refined by this process. Let us explain electrolytic
