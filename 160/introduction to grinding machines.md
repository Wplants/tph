## Introduction to the Physics of Machining - Massachusetts Institute of 
The depth of cut refers to the width of material in contact with the tool. In some machines, like the drilling machine, this is related to the speed and feed rates. In other machines, it is also dependent on the position of the tool relative to the work piece. On the grinding-type tools, the width depends on how much of the surface is being ground.

## introduction to grinding machine
A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally, the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality, accuracy of the shape and dimension.

The grinding wheel is mainly used to rotate and grind the workpiece to achieve the required flatness. According to the shape of the worktable, it can be divided into two types: rectangular worktable and round worktable. The main parameters of the rectangular worktable surface grinding machines are the width and length of the worktable.
