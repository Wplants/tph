## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

More On The Types Of Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock made of shells, exoskeletons or marine life, calcite, and calcium carbonate. When you think of the different variations of those things coming together in nature, it makes sense that the rock comes in many different shades, colors, and forms, depending on the condition in which it forms.
