## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## What Happens To Limestone When It Is Dissolved In Water - Realonomics
The limestone dissolves to form a salt (in the chemical sense) water and carbon dioxide. How does limestone react with water? Limestone (CaCO 3) reacts with hydrogen ions in water. These are always present in water since water undergoes autoprotolysis: H 2 O(l) = H + (aq) + OH - (aq) The more acidic the water is the more limestone will react

## processed limestone
Limestone is an alkaline agent with the ability to neutralize, or partially neutralize strong acids. The neutralization process occurs when strong acids, in intimate contact with limestone chips, react with Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3, the primary constituent of limestone) to form water, carbon dioxide, and calcium salts.
