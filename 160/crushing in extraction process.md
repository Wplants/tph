## cement - Extraction and processing | Britannica
Extraction and processing. Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing

## Processing canola seed into oil and meal in Canada
A small proportion of Canadian canola is processed without solvent extraction and in some cases also without the use of heat. Double press or expeller press. In this process, canola seed is pressed a second time to extract oil without using solvents. Up to that point, the preconditioning process may be the same as for traditional processing.
