## Coal in South Africa
South Africa produces in excess of 255 million tonnes of coal (2011 estimate) and consumes almost three-quarters of that domestically. As of 2018, South Africa was the seventh largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. This large industry, means that as of 2015 about 80,000 workers, or .5% of total employment, was from the coal industry, down from a peak in 1981 of 135,000 workers.

Positive impacts [ edit] Mining is of great importance to many communities and has helped to improve their standard of living. Gold mining allows people to earn cash. It is easier and quicker to earn cash with gold mining than with farming or cattle-rearing. It takes a long for a farmer to grow, harvest, and then sell his or her crops.

## The Impact Of Covid-19 On The Mining Sector
South Africa's mining sector is particularly exposed to the spread of Covid-19. According to the Minerals Council of South Africa, the industry employs a workforce numbering almost 420,000, many of whom are underground on any given day. Some mines have thousands of men and women underground, descending into the depths in crowded "cages".

## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
When mining industries are well managed, countries like Peru, Chile, and Botswana have seen massive economic growth. Mining is crucial for developed nations as well. For example, mining makes up 20% of South Africa's total GDP and employs over 1 million people. People estimate that South Africa sits on over$2.5-trillion in mineral reserves.
