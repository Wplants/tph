A method for activation of bentonites is described. The method comprises a prior treatment of the bentonite with an organic polymer and/or an aqueous alkaline solution as known from prior art. Subsequently, an amount of 0.01 - 10% by weight from the treated bentonite of a heavy metal salt is incorporated into the pretreated bentonite and then dried at a temperature not higher than 400C.
