## Perfecting the Performance of Secondary Crushers | E & MJ
For mineral processing, secondary crushing can be used to prepare feed for downstream processes or to go directly to leaching. Downstream processes typically include tertiary crushing or primary grinding, with the tertiary crushers often being cone crushers or high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGRs), and the primary grinding mills being autogenous

Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary crushing (although impact crushers are sometimes used), which typically reduces material to about 2.5 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches). The material (throughs) from the second level of the screen bypasses the secondary crusher because it is sufficiently small for the last crushing step.

## Secondary Crushers Processing
For mineral processing, secondary crushing can be used to prepare feed for downstream processes or to go directly to leaching. Downstream processes typically include tertiary crushing or primary grinding, with the tertiary crushers often being cone crushers or high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGRs), and the primary grinding mills being autogenous
