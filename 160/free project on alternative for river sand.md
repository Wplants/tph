## Alternatives for River Sand: the potential of offshore sand!
The overuse of river sand for construction has various undesirable social and ecological consequences. As a solution for this, various alternatives such as offshore sand, quarry dust (or manufactured sand), dune sand and washed soil have been considered. This research focuses on using offshore sand as the most viable alternative for river sand.
