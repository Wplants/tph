Portland Cement Tensile Strength. Although PCC is not nearly as strong in tension as it is in compression, PCC tensile strength is important in pavement applications. Tensile strength is typically used as a PCC performance measure for pavements because it best simulates tensile stresses at the bottom of the PCC surface course as it is subjected

## Why Does Concrete Require Reinforcement? - Modern Design
Fibers can increase the strength of concrete. Concrete reinforcement fibers are added into the concrete while it's wet and being mixed. This helps ensure an even distribution of fibers throughout the concrete. While fibers don't increase concrete's tensile strength as much as rebar, there's still a benefit.

Rebar's primary purpose is to increase the tensile strength of concrete. This additional strength helps it resist cracking and compensates for concrete's inherent weakness. With greater tensile strength, concrete is able to resist breaking under tension which means it can safely span larger distances. It's because of rebar being used in
