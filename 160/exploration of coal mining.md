Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.

## Coal Geology | Geoscience Australia
Modern coal exploration typically involves extensive use of geophysical surveys, including 3D seismic surveys aimed at providing detailed information on the structures with the potential to affect longwall operations, and drilling to determine coal quality and thickness.  Many underground coal mines in Australia use longwall mining methods

## 25.1 Exploration: Finding minerals | Mining of mineral resources - Siyavula
Exploration methods are used to find, and assess the quality of mineral deposits, prior to mining. Generally a number of explorative techniques are used, and the results are then compared to see if a location seems suitable for mining. Remote sensing is the term used to gain information from a distance.

Abstract. Coal is a low-cost commodity and coal miners profit margins are slim, such that mining companies must maintain tight cost control to achieve acceptable returns. The challenge to coal geophysics is to adapt to these economic constraints and provide cost-effective, reliable methods for exploration and mining requirements.
