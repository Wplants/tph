At Sterlite Copper the sulphur dioxide gases generated during copper smelting process is collected and ducted to the Sulphuric Acid Plant. Set up with basic engineering from Kvaerner Chemetics, Canada, the plant is based on the absorption process known as DCDA, and can produce about 12,00,000 tonnes of Sulphuric Acid per annum.

Hydrochloric and phosphoric acid don't oxidize metals well and won't dissolve copper. Sulfuric acid has a medium oxidizing ability and will dissolve copper over time. With a high oxidative strength, nitric acid will completely dissolve copper, turning it green and then blue as the metal wears away in a matter of minutes.

Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.

This process consumes 2,500 to 3,000 kWh · t -1 of copper produced. The copper is deposited on the cathode and the gases produced at the anode (O 2, Cℓ 2) are recovered selectively and returned to the process. This method produces an extremely pure copper that can then be rolled (hot or cold), drawn or even formed into tubes before being sold.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

At Sterlite Copper the sulphur dioxide gases generated during copper smelting process is collected and ducted to the Sulphuric Acid Plant. Set up with basic engineering from Kvaerner Chemetics, Canada, the plant is based on the absorption process known as DCDA, and can produce about 12,00,000 tonnes of Sulphuric Acid per annum.
