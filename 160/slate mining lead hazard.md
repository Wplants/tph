## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Mining the ore : The first step requires the lead ore to be mined from the grounds. Heavy machinery is used to drill the rocks from deep tunnels or blast it with dynamite, breaking the ore into pieces. The ore is then shoveled onto loaders and trucks and hauled to a shaft. The miners dump the ore down the shaft, and from there it is hoisted to
