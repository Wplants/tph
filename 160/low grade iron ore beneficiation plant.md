## beneficiation of low grade iron ore
Here, bench-scale results are presented on the beneficiation of low-grade Fe ore fines using STET belt separation process. Bench-scale testing demonstrated the capability of the STET technology to simultaneously recover Fe and reject SiO2 from itabirite ore with a D50 of 60Âµm and ultrafine Fe ore tailings with a D50 of 20Âµm.
