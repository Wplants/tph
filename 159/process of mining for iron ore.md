## How Does Mining Equipment Work in Iron Ore Mining?
Hematite and limonite, magnetite and goethite, the mining operation is extracting the rock and crushing it until the rocky deposits are evenly sized. Remember, the deposits are somewhat soft, even crumbly, but there's raw iron trapped inside the ore. Given time, the ore will age the mining equipment, deform the system parts, and hamstring

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

When the iron ore is extracted from the mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals.  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier.
