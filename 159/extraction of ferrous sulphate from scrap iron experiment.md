Ferrous sulfate, FeO4S PubChem. Iron(2+) sulfate (anhydrous) is a compound of iron and sulfate in which the ratio of iron(2+) to sulfate ions is 11. Various hydrates occur naturally most commonly the heptahydrate, which loses water to form the tetrahydrate at 57degreeC and the monohydrate at 65degreeC.

## Bioleaching
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide. Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt

## preparation of ferrous sulphate from scrap iron
03/01/2020 Ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4 .7H 2 O), traditionally known as "green vitriol" or "copperas", forms beautiful blue-green crystals of the monoclinic system. Ferrous sulphate is prepared by reacting iron in excess of dilute sulphuric acid.
