The closer you bring the ratio to an even one-to-one of sand to cement, the stronger the rating becomes. This principles works in the opposite direction as well. If you want to get a little more technical, some concrete experts recommend going for 26 percent sand, 41 percent gravel, 11 percent cement and 16 percent water.

## Use of recycled glass for concrete masonry blocks. Final report
Abstract. A two-year research project was conducted to study the technical and economic feasibility of using mixed-color crushed waste glass for concrete masonry. From a technical standpoint, two problems had to be confronted. First, it was known that the silica in glass is highly reactive in the alkaline environment of portland cement concrete.

## Effect of different sand grading on strength properties of cement grout 
This paper aims to study the consistency and strength properties of cement grouts prepared with three different sand grading namely 100% passing through 1.18 mm sieve (P1.18 mm), 0.90 mm sieve (P0.90 mm) and 0.60 mm sieve (P0.60 mm), respectively.The measured flowing time indicated that the specimens with the finer sand grading had lower flowability than those of the coarser sand grading.

## Compressive Strength of Cement and Test to find it - CIVIL READ
Assume the test specimen is of 28 days old and max compression load at which the specimen starts breaking is 165KN. As per above fig, Surface are is 50Sq.cm = 5000mm 2. 1 KN = 1000N = 165 x 1000 = 165000. As per formula, Compressive strength of cement = 165000/5000 = 33N/mm2. Hence, the Grade of cement is 33 Grade.

## How Does the Ratio of Sand to Cement Affect the Strength of Concrete 
Adjusting the strength of concrete based on the ratio of sand to cement is easy to do. The closer you bring the ratio to an even one-to-one ratio of sand to cement, the stronger you will make the concrete. On the other hand, if you push the ratio in the other direction you will get a product that has slightly less strength.

## Could Desert Sand be Used to Make Concrete?
The combination of sand, water, and cement make concrete. Each element performs a function essential to making the material long-lasting and incredibly sturdy. To put it simply, concrete is made from cement mixing with water to form a paste that acts like glue; the mixture needs an aggregate to be complete.

## Properties of Concrete Blocks — Strength
In the use of concrete blocks for the walls of buildings, the stress to which they are subjected is almost entirely one of compression. In compressive strength well-made concrete does not differ greatly from ordinary building stone. It is difficult to find reliable records of tests of sand and gravel concrete, 1 to 4 and 1 to 5, such as is used in making blocks; the following figures show
