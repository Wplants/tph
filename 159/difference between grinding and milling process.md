## difference between grinding amp milling - Macher
Dec 18, 2013 Fine grinding, to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm, is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes. This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding, it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.

## A Comparison of Honing and Lapping - Metal Cutting Corporation
Lapping is a sanding or polishing method used to create an accurate finish on a flat or domed surface of a part. Honing is a method of internal grinding used to achieve a precise surface finish and shape on the inside diameter (ID) of a tube, bore, or hole. The honing and lapping processes are both highly controlled.

## What is the Difference Between Turning, Drilling and Milling Operations 
Drilling produces a round hole in a workpiece. A tapping or drill press machine performs drilling operations. However, drilling can also be handled with a milling machine. When machining a workpiece, chips are the waste material produced during the machining process. The way the drill bit is shaped enables chips to fall away from the workpiece.
