The cut-off is reduced to 1.0% total copper where the ore body is thin and richly mineralised. For the Nchanga open-pit ore bodies, a cut-off grade of 0.5% total copper is used. Open-pit mining has historically been exploited near surface ore bodies, including the LOB, UOB, River Lode, Luano and Chingola Ore Bodies.

Open pit machinery can also be used for other purposes such as civil construction, whereas underground mining equipment is specialized and expensive. A number of surface mines operate 24 hours/da y and almost 365 days/year in order to use open pit machinery for as many hours as possible, thereby reducing the number of machines required.

Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.
