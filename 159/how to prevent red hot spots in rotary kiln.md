## Common Rotary Kiln Processing Challenges - FEECO International Inc.
Ring formation is extremely common, occurring in roughly 85% of commercial rotary kilns. It is typically the result of a change in slagging temperature. The slagging temperature is the point at which the material will fuse together, allowing it to solidify. If a change in feed composition that reduces the slagging temperature is allowed to
