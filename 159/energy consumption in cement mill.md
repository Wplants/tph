These technologies have helped the industry reduce its energy consumption per tonne of cement by 30 percent since the mid-1970s.  Blue Circle Cement's Bowmanville facility replaced the inlet fan damper in its coal mill with a variable inlet vane damper. The resulting reduction in power consumption saved the company $75,000 in annual energy

The consumption of the energy in the cement plant is mainly due to raw mill, cooler, pre-heater and rotary kiln [14]. The total energy loss of the plant is generally accounted for about 35-39% of the total energy input [15]. This energy loss is due to the loss from the exhaust gas, cooler and the radiation heat transfer from the kiln cell.

The main power consumption of a clinker cooler is its cooling fans. It usually takes 1.9-2.3 m 3 under standard conditions to cool 1 kg clinker from 1400 ℃ to 65 ℃, and the power consumption of the whole system is about 7 kWh. If the air consumption per kilogram of clinker cooling is reduced from 2 m 3 to 1.7 m 3, the air consumption efficiency will be 15% lower than that of other cement

## 7 Effective Methods for Energy Consumption of Cement Grinding Plant 
Jun 16, 2021To achieve energy saving and consumption reduction in the cement industry, we must proceed from the cement grinding unit. Through a series of research and analysis, the following seven effective methods can effectively reduce the energy consumption of cement grinding plant. 1. Improve raw materials and products, and mix materials.

## Cement | Bureau of Energy Efficiency
Based on the threshold defined, 85 number of cement plants were included as DCs and their cumulative energy consumption were 15.01 million MTOE in PAT Cycle-1. Based on their specific energy consumption level, these DCs were given SEC target reduction of an average 5.43% resulting in 0.815 million TOE energy consumption reduction in absolute
