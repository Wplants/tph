TLDR: Security is a mindset, think about every aspect of vulnerability when you design the data system.

It is reasonably easy to determine a thickener area requirement from settling data but that is simply the first step on a fairly long journey. You must apply judgement to the calculations to allow for surges in feed rate and for process plant tonnage increases, ore mineralogy etc. Rakes and rake torque control is also very important.

Advances in thickener design have improved the degree of separation possible from tailings streams, however limiting the selection criteria to just the thickener can constrain the operation potential. Integrating ancillaries, automation and operator training with the equipment can improve operational outcomes and decrease operating costs.

## Sludge treatment − dissolved air flotation thickening
DAF thickeners are fitted with scrapers - as with gravity thickeners - to collect the sediment. The air to solids ratio is the mass of air employed per unit mass of sludge solids. For sludge thickening applications, this ratio is normally in the range 0.02−0.06 kg air/kg DS.

## High Rate Thickeners - Solid Liquid Separation
Description. The High-Rate thickeners became popular in the mid 1980's and are relatively newcomers to the sedimentation line of equipment. As already discussed previously Thickeners are a major component in a plant layout and occupy large spaces which may be saved by introducing high-rate machines. Furthermore, they are normally positioned far away from the center of the plant so to allow
