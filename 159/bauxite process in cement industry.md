The mixture then sent to final grinding process. For ordinary Portland cement it remains between 3 to 4% and in case of Quick setting cement it can be reduced up to 2.5%. Role of Gypsum in Cement The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water.

## Bauxite
Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

## Bauxite, calcined | Cement, Construction Materials and Civil 
Information. Calcined bauxite is produced by sintering/calcining of low iron, low alkali containing raw bauxites at temperatures of 1600 - 1800 degree Celsius. In this calcination process the high refractory mineral phases corundum and mullite are formed. Therefore calcined bauxite is one of the most important raw materials for the production
