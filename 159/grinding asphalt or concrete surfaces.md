While diamond grinding is effective at leveling an uneven surface, it is not an efficient method for flattening a non-flat surface. If your concrete area features a crack or damaged section that is creating a protrusion or tripping hazard, the amount of grinding necessary to flatten the area will cost more in equipment and material costs, and likely result in unevenness in other areas as a result.

What Is Asphalt Milling? Asphalt millings are the result of grinding up old and worn out asphalt, allowing it to take on a shape similar to gravel. Unlike gravel though, asphalt millings will bind together when compacted down, making them a great alternative to gravel roads, driveways, parking lots, and as a recycled addition to fresh asphalt.

## Noise emission of concrete pavement surfaces produced by diamond grinding
Moreover in the United States, a special type of surface is used to reduce noise emission, the so-called Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) which currently provides the best noise reduction for concrete pavement (Scofield et al., 2010).The production of NGCS consists of a combination of diamond grinding with minimum separation of the segments and conventional grooving.

## Grinding Asphalt Or Concrete Surfaces
Asphalt Commercial Asphalt Paving Concrete Services. Transitional Milling In areas requiring the resurface to tie into other existing surfaces (i.e., concrete, etc.), asphalt will be milled and replaced to allow proper depth and transitions. An asphalt milling machine is used to remove an appropriate depth of pavement in a grinding process.
