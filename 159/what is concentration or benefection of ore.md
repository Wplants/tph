## CBSE Class 12 : Concentration of Ores, Chemistry - Unacademy
Ores are solid materials that can be used to produce pure metals. Concentration, dressing, or benefaction of ores is extracting undesirable particles from ore. There are various steps to it. The variations in physical characteristics of the existing metal complex and that of the gangue are used to separate the needed material from the ore.
