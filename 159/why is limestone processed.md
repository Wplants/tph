## How Are Limestone Caves Formed? (Images + Interesting Facts)
Mar 4, 2022Underground limestone caves form through the natural chemical weathering process described above. Most caves form in karst, a landscape composed of limestone, gypsum, and dolomite rocks that dissolve gradually in slightly acidic water.. The water eats away the bedrock, forming underground passages that take as many as 100,000 years to become large enough for human entry.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Aug 15, 2022Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
