## Iron ore slimes beneficiation using optimised  - ScienceDirect
Aug 1, 2022The iron (Fe) content of such ores ranges from 72% to 35%. The highly friable and fully liberated constituents in ore, such as alumina and silica, generate a large quantity of fines during mechanized mining and crushing. Fine gangue material or iron ore slimes having <45%-55% Fe are discarded as reject during the ore beneficiation process.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process
Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.
