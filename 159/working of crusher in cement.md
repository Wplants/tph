## How does an impact crusher work? | RUBBLE MASTER
What are the benefits of an impact crusher? Impact crushers reduce mineral materials such as concrete, asphalt and natural rock in size to produce a valuable commodity product. A fast spinning rotor throws the material against a solid stationary impact wall. The striking and impacting causes the material to shatter into smaller pieces.
