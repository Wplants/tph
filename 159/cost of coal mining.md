## Coal mining cost inflation to resume | CRU
Extremely high and volatile metallurgical coal prices since mid-2016 have, after 3-4 years of scrutiny on cost reduction, shifted the focus of the industry away from costs of production - with spot prices spiking to ~200% above average costs of the industry, as they have done twice in the last year or so, changes to operating costs have, inevitably, seemed of little importance.

Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.  Coal Mining Industry in India (1998)

The transportation costs depend on whether the coal is imported from the seaborne market or purchased domestically from a nearby mine.

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal
