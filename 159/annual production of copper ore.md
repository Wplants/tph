The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

Copper production fell from 400 000 tonnes per annum in 1990, to 250 000 at the end of the decade. By the time the re-privatisation process had been concluded in 2000, the mining industry could only provide 22 000 direct jobs. To put this in perspective, "an average of about 2 000 mining jobs were lost every year (.) during the 24 years
