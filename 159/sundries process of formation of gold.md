Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## How Is Gold Formed - American Mining Rights Association
Placer Gold. Placer gold is formed from already existing lode and intrusive gold deposits. Placer gold is caused by the eroding effect of water upon rock. Rain and the flow of rivers against them will erode rock walls releasing the minerals contained within. These minerals including gold will flow downhill entering into rivers and streams.

Gold itself is a rare metal and the average grades for low-grade deposits vary between 3 and 6 ppm. Gold occurs predominantly in native form in silicate veins, alluvial and placer deposits or encapsulated in sulphides. Other common occurrences of gold are alloys with copper, tellurium, antimony, selenium, platinum group metals and silver.

## Formation of gold | Ergo
Ancient Greeks believed that gold was formed by the rays of the sun transforming common metals in the earth. Scientists today still think that gold formation is related to stars, specifically dying stars. At the core of a dying star - a supernova - elements begin to fuse together in the extreme heat.

The gold content of the deposit is partially controlled by alteration of chimney fragments during mass-wasting. Gold appears to be lost during this process, most prevalently from sulfide formed at beehive chimneys. The high gold concentrations found in all chimney samples at the BVF suggest an underlying reason for high gold.
