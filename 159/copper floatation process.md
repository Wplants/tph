The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

## Copper-flotation-process | What-is-flotation-in-oxide-copper-extraction 
May 30, 2022The direct flotation process of oxide copper ore is treated with scavengers, mainly including fatty acid flotation method, amine collector flotation method, chelating agent-neutral oil flotation method and emulsion flotation method. It is often used in simple structure., The nature of relatively simple oxide copper ore. The fatty acid

## Copper beneficiation process - Yantai Jinpeng Mining equipment, ore 
Copper ore divides into ore sulfide,ore oxide and mixing ore according to its oxide rate . The main process for copper ore is flotation, for refractory mixed copper ore and refractory oxide ore, normally use hydrometallurgy process .It is a high technological enterprise that integrated research, manufacture, sales and service . The company has multiple subsidiaries such as Mineral
