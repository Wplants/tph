The classification accuracy is 100% for the N3 model, which shows better predictive capabilities than the KNN model for the classification of iron ore. Therefore, LIBS technique combined with N3 could be a promising method for real-time online, rapid analysis in mining and mineral processing industries.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Comminution and classification technologies of iron ore
Jan 1, 2022Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores are typically subjected to simple dry processes of crushing and classification to meet the size specifications required for direct shipping ore (DSO). This involves multistages of crushing and screening to obtain lump (−31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately −6.3 mm) products.
