## calcined impure gypsum
Amarna gypsite A new source of gypsum for ancient Egypt, When gypsum is heated calcined between 100 and 170 176 C, it loses three-fourths of its water to become a material variously known as burnt gypsum, plaster-of-Paris, and the mineral bassaniteWhen mixed with water, bassanite recrystallizes back to gypsum and in the process forms a moderately hard material that can be used as a plaster or

## A Novel Process to Recover Gypsum from Phosphogypsum
Mar 5, 2022The test results show that a gypsum concentrate with a CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O purity of 98.94%, CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O recovery of 80.02%, and whiteness of 37.05 was achieved. The main mineral in the gypsum concentrate was gypsum, and limited amounts of muscovite and zoisite entered the gypsum concentrate because of the mechanical entrainment of the
