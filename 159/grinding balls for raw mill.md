## Grinding Mills and Their Types - IspatGuru
Ball mills. Ball mill (Fig 1) is same kind of mill as rod mill, except that it is filled with balls instead of rods. Because of balls have greater ratio of surface area than rods they are more suitable for fine grinding. Balls are also lighter, so the kinetic energy of a single dropping ball is smaller than a rod.
