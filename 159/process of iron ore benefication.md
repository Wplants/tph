## Why beneficiation of iron ore is necessary? Explained by FAQ Blog
Which of the following is a process of beneficiation? In the case of a lower-grade iron ore, the beneficiation process includes activities such as crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening and silica froth flotation. These activities will help improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.
