## Storing Malt Grains Before Brewing - How Long Is Too Long?
When stored correctly, grains used in brewing have a storage life of 6 months to a year. Moisture & O2 exposure are the biggest risks. Chilling & freezing lead to the longest shelf-life and unmalted and unmilled grains generally also last longer. After 12 months, grains should be replaced if unused.
