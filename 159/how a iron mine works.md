## Thomas Edison at an Iron Mine, Ogden, New Jersey, 1895
During the 1890s, Thomas Edison launched a New Jersey mining operation to address an iron ore shortage. He designed rock-crushing technology and an electromagnetic ore separator to extract low-grade ore from crushed boulders. The final product -- a briquette made of powdered iron ore -- didn't do well commercially, especially after high-grade ore was discovered around Lake Superior. In 1899

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Understanding How The Indian Steel Industry Works | Part 1
Sintered iron ore and coke are layered inside a 100 m long furnace, then hot air at 1200 degree Celsius is blown into the blast furnace from the bottom causing the coal to burn and this heat, in turn, burns the iron ore to create molten iron at a temperature of 1500 degree Celsius. This is also called hot metal (pig iron) in the industry.

## Iron Ore | HowStuffWorks
Smelting involves heating up ore until the metal becomes spongy and the chemical compounds in the ore begin to break down. Most important, it releases oxygen from the iron ore, which makes up a high percentage of common iron ores. The most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery. There, a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and
