## What is gypsum stone used for? - Short-Facts
What is stone gypsum? Gypsum is a naturally occurring stone, a metallic salt of calcium.  Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral. Gypsum is also formed as a by-product of sulfide oxidation, amongst others by pyrite oxidation, when the sulfuric acid generated reacts with calcium carbonate. Its presence indicates oxidizing conditions.

## Gypsum - Metaphysical Healing Properties
Gypsum is one of the more common minerals in sedimentary environments. It is a major rock forming mineral that produces massive beds, usually from precipitation out of highly saline waters. Since it forms easily from saline water, gypsum can have many inclusions of other minerals and even trapped bubbles of air and water.
