## Smelting high sulfides Gold concentrates | Gold Refining & Metal 
Most small scale miners have neither the equipment nor the expertise to get good gravity separation on a sulfide ore. Those that can get good separation either have an ore which has sulfide liberation at a coarse milling size or they accept that they have to mill fine and put the milled product over the table at a very slow feed rate.

## Everything You Need to Know About the Process of Smelting Gold
This method of gold smelting uses a flux, a substance made of borax and sodium carbonate that removes impurities from gold. The first step is to buy a crucible container, used for holding the gold as it melts. This is a container created specifically for this process as it can withstand the heat used during the melting process.
