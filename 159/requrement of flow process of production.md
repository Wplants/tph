Flow or Continuous Production. Flow production, also known as continuous production, occurs when a process runs twenty-four hours a day. Companies whose products are homogeneous use this production approach to reduce cost and increase efficiency. These systems are highly automated, and workers act as monitors rather than as active participants.
