In general, crushing is carried out in three stages, depending on the desired size of the material. Primary Crushing. This is the first stage of the crushing process. In general, the size of the feed material, which is between 800 and 1500 mm, is reduced to between 150 and 300 mm. Secondary Crushing. This is the second stage of crushing.
