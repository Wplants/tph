## Instant stone (just add water!) - The Roots of Progress
Limestone is a soft, light-colored rock with a grainy texture, which fizzes in the presence of acid. Chalk is a form of limestone. What distinguishes limestone and makes it useful is a high calcium content ("calcium" and "chalk" are cognates). Specifically, it is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), the same substance that makes up seashells.

## Introduction to Polymer-Modified Concrete
Portland cement contains a few primary substances, including limestone, sand or clay, bauxite, and iron ore. To make cement, these different components are mixed and heated to form an intermediary, pebble-like substance called clinker. The clinker is then ground down to a powder that is mixed with water to form a paste.
