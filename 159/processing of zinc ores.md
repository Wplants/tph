## Review of the hydrometallurgical processing of non-sulfide zinc ores 
Abstract. Non-sulfide zinc deposits were the prime source for zinc metal production for hundreds of years. However, during the early 20th century, their significance diminished due to the development of flotation and smelting techniques for zinc sulfides. At the present time, zinc sulfide ores are the most significant source of zinc, accounting

## Zinc mining
Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining.A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc minerals in ore as its primary product. Common co-products in zinc ores include minerals of lead and silver.Other mines may produce zinc minerals as a by-product of the production of ores containing more valuable minerals or metals, such as

## Zinc smelting
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific

## processing of zinc ores
 Sulphide ores and concentrates Most zinc ores occur as sulphides and, as such, are amenable to upgrading by flotation. The traditional treatment route includes smelting of the concentrates, followed by hydromet-allurgical processing to produce electrolytic zinc metal. Direct ore processing via a hydrometallurgical route could enable

The problem of treating oxidized lead-zinc ores for the production of high-grade lead zinc concentrates is a complex problem due to the nature of the ores and to the soft sliming characteristics of the lead and zinc minerals.

## Review of the Hydrometallurgical Processing of Non-Sulfide Zinc Ores 
Because of the rising demand for zinc metal and the decreasing zinc sulfide ore reserves, in recent years, the interest for the processing of nonsulfide zinc ores, and especially smithsonite

## Why zinc carbonate is calcined?tankandlift
What happened when zinc carbonate is heated in the absence of oxygen? Answer : (a) When zinc carbonate is heated in the absence of oxygen, zinc oxide and carbon dioxide are produced. The process of reduction carbonate ores to form oxides in absence of oxygen is called calcination.
