## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Mining remains an essential and growing part of the modern industry. By some estimates, it makes up nearly 45% of the total global economy, and mineral production continues to increase as demand for raw materials grows around the world.. However, many mining techniques still in use can have serious impacts on both the mining site itself and the surrounding environment.

Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.

Feb 17, 2021Variants of open pit mining are limited to a number of other surface mining methods, which include strip mining, high wall mining, and quarrying. Strip (open cast) mining is used extensively for the surface mining of important commodities such as coal and phosphate ores. Casting is the process of excavation and dumping into a final location.

Opencast Mining Equipment Outlook. · Opencast Mining - an overview ScienceDirect . The total loss of coal (L) during opencast mining (Talwar, 1978) is due to the following four factors: L = l 1 + l 2 + l 3 + l 4 where, l 1, losses of coal in the roof and floor of the seam; l 2, losses of coal while cleaning the roof of the bench; l 3, losses of coal during selective mining of seams

May 19, 2022Nov 28, 2014 · The opencast coal mining technique is used in areas were the coal reserves are scattered in shallow and thin seams and cannot be extracted by deep mining methods (Beynon et al., 2000). The opencast process starts with exploration activities to identify where there are deposits of coal and what is the depth of the seams.

## Everything You Need To Know About Open Pit Mining - Positive Points
It describes the process of systematically excavating land and digging out the rocks and minerals in search of metallic ores and removing them via borrow or open pit. The open pit mining method (also known as opencast, open-cut, or strip mining) is not extractive; meaning that most of the time there no need to tunnel directly into the earth.
