## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.  The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C

Alkaline cyanide solutions are used to extract gold from ores. Because the ores are finely ground (unlike heap-leaching), large quantities of fine tailings are produced and require storage in tailings dams. The tailings will be acidic in the case of copper processing and alkaline in the case of gold processing. 13.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

The above pre-treatment stages can be changed based on ore mineralogy. For a complex Au-Ag ore, direct cyanide leaching resulted in only about 47% and 19% extraction of gold and silver even after very fine grinding at <38 µm.Diagnostic leaching was carried out to assess the nature of refractoriness [29].Depending on the results of the diagnostic test results, extraction strategies for gold

##  Processing Gold Ores Using Heap Leach-Carbon Adsorption Methods
MINERALOGY OF GOLD ORES The manner of gold occurrence and its association with the gangue miner- als dictate whether or not the ore can be processed by the cyanide heap-leach method. From a metallurgical standpoint, gold ores may be roughly classified as (1) simple oxide ores containing fine particles of native gold in a quartz
