## EnviroGulf Consulting - Mining and Arsenic
Mining and Arsenic. Arsenic occurs in various mineral forms, as arsenides in sulphide minerals and as arsenates. The most common mineral is arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is also found in arsenolite (As 2 O 3), olivenite (Cu 2 OHAsO 4), mimetite (Pb 5 Cl(AsO 4) 3 and cobaltite (CoAsS).. In the weathering of sulphides, arsenic can be oxidised to arsenite and arsenate.

Arsenic is a substance found in the environment. It occurs naturally in crushed rock. It is often found near gold deposits and is extracted as part of gold and other mining activities. The waste left over after mining processes is called mine tailings. Mine tailings often look like fine clay or sand and commonly contain raised levels of arsenic.

## The Legacy of Arsenic Contamination from Mining and Processing 
The case of the Giant mine illustrates how a large, long-lived Au mine has resulted in a complex regional legacy of As contamination and an estimated remediation cost of almost one billion Canadian dollars (AANDC 2012). The mine, located a few km north of the city of Yellowknife on the shore of Great Slave Lake (Figs. 1, 2) produced more than 7 million troy ounces of Au (approximately 220

## Arsenic
Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal.Arsenic is a metalloid.It has various allotropes, but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.. The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car
