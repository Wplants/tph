## Ball Mills - The Ceramic Shop
Ball Mills. In ceramics, ball mills are used to grind down materials into very fine particles. Materials such as clay and glaze components can be broken down in a ball mill by getting placed into rotating or rolling jars with porcelain balls inside them. During milling, the porcelain balls pulverized the materials into an incredibly fine powder.

When learning how to wedge, you should start with one to three pounds (.50 to 1.4 kg) of clay. A scale is an important part of playing with clay especially being a new potter, you need to know how much clay is needed to make different items or to make a few of the same size items. You don't want your clay balls to be too small or too large.

## Ceramic forming techniques - HiSoUR - Hi So You Are
There are many forming techniques to make ceramics, but one example is slipcasting. This is where slip or, liquid clay, is poured into a plaster mould. The water in the slip is drawn out into the walls of the plaster mould, leaving an inside layer of solid clay, which hardens quickly. When dry, the solid clay can then also be removed.
