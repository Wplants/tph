## Construction Aggregates 101: What They Are (and Why They Matter) - AEM
Jul 8, 2021Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.

The aggregate is the base material for concrete and provides bulk (70-80% of cement concrete volume is coarse aggregate). It limits the shrinkage of cement concrete upon drying. The coarse and fine aggregate mixture is used as a base and sub-base course in road construction. The coarse aggregate mixed with bitumen is used in wearing coats of roads.

## How to Choose Quality Coarse Aggregate for Concrete Construction?
To ensure good coarse aggregate compaction and higher concrete density, it is recommended to mix 20 mm and 10 mm coarse aggregates in the ratio of 70:30 or 60:40. It is recommended to stack different aggregate sizes to use them efficiently. Prevent the use of friable and chert aggregates. The former is susceptible to splitting, whereas the
