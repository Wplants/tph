Dry beneficiation of coal. The quantities of coal being beneficiated and the levels of beneficiation required are increasing while the quality of raw coals is decreasing. Although coal is currently cleaned with the minimum of size reduction, fine particle processing, recovery, and tailings disposal are already major problems.

## Thermo-adhesive Separation: a Novel Dry Coal Beneficiation Technique 
Jan 6, 2022Water is the mainstay for beneficiation of fine size coal and minerals; however, it is also the least desirable constituent in the final product. The basic concept of the novel process described in this paper is based on the differential surface heat conduction/absorption capacity of individual particles, which differs for different species of minerals. When a mixture of fine material is

## Dry beneficiation of coal: A review | Semantic Scholar
To intensify the production of coal, mechanisation of coal mining is gradually increasing. The process, being less selective, increases the quantity of shales, stones and other impurities in coal. Dry methods of separation of these impurities may serve as a preconcentration step prior to wet processes of beneficiation. Dry beneficiation will eliminate the energy intensive process of dewatering

## Coal Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only),  Wet cleaning is mostly used for metallurgical coals, whereas there is a general trend to use dry beneficiation for thermal coals.

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.
