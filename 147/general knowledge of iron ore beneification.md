The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3). Quartz dissipates easily, breaking down to fines with little applied stress. Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

##  Chapter-8 Beneficiation of Iron Ores
C is one for very thin disc, and zero for very long rod. For general ore particles it varies from 0.15 to 0.25 Any change in field intensity causes the change in permeability and hence flux density. If field intensity is increased the flux density also increases. When a particle placed in to a homogeneous magnetic field, the particle is exposed

## Iron ore beneficiation technologies - GoodRich MAGMA
We offer dry beneficiation plants to up-grade the contaminated hematite iron ores. In the dry beneficiation process, iron ore is ground to 0-2 mm size. After screening, the fines are passed through a very high gauss rare earth magnetic separator (up to 8,000 gauss). A demo plant has been set up & experiments on many types of raw materials were
