## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022Cone crusher looks like gyratory crusher but without a steep crushing chamber. Just like jaw crusher, it is also a compression type crusher whose reduction ratio is 4:1 to 6:1. When cone crusher works, it uses the force between moveable mantle and stationary bowl liner to crush material.

## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
