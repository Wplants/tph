Coke. Coking coal is converted to coke by driving off impurities to leave almost pure carbon. The coking coal is crushed and washed. It is then 'purified' or 'carbonised' in a series of coke ovens, known as batteries, where the coking coal is heated to ºC in the absence of oxygen for 12-36 hours. During this process, by

## Hard Coal vs Soft Coal | Alternate Heating Systems
For example, trains that run on steam sometimes are fueled with "bit coal," a nickname for bituminous coal. Metallurgical Coal on the other hand is sometimes referred to as "coking" coal and is used in the process of creating coke necessary for iron and steel production.

## How the global steel industry is cutting out coal | The Narwhal
May 1, 2021Steel-making has conventionally relied on metallurgical coal, which is rich in carbon, in the production of pure iron, essential in steel. The coal is used for heating, but also for a chemical reaction in which a carbon-dense substance called coke, derived from coal, reacts with iron ore to leave pure iron.

## What You Should Know About Metallurgical Coal - ThoughtCo
Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke, the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. Coal is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock formed over millions of years as plants and other organic materials are buried and subjected to geological forces.

##  Differentiation of coking & non-coking coals - Auroma
A Caking coal, when heated in a similar way, leaves a solid coherent residue. The caking coal might give a coke which may not be accepted by the steel plants as it does not possess the requisite physical and chemical properties of the coke. A coking coal is that coal which on heating in absence of air leaves a solid residue.

## Metallurgical coal | BHP
Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

Coke also has a higher amount of ash content than coal. Coke is rich in carbon, with a calorific value of about 6,000 BTU per pound. It gives off energy at temperatures exceeding 3,800 degrees Celsius when burning. Coal contains around 30-60% carbon but produces carbon dioxide and soot when it burns. Coal's calorific value is around 3,800

Coal Coke Coal Coke is created by cooking Coal in a Coke Oven. Even though coal coke is produced slowly in the coke oven (2.5 minutes per piece), it is a highly effective fuel as it essentially produces double the heat content of the Coal required to create it. Coal has a heat content of 1600 (3200 in Railcraft), whereas Coal Coke has a heat content of 6400. This means that Coal Coke will last

Beehive ovens are still used for special kinds of coke, but modern rectangular coke ovens can hold far larger charges—up to 33 metric tons (36 U.S. tons) of coal—and also permit the recovery of a number of coal by-products. One ton of coal produces 0.7 tons of coke. The largest plants can discharge 5 to 10 million metric tons of coke annually.
