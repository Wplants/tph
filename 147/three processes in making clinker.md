## three processes in making clinker
The process of making cement clinker may be subdivided into three different steps In the first step, the finely ground raw material is heated to about 600° C In this step, no essential reactions take place, with the exception of the dehydration of the clay (alumina) minerals The second process step is characterized by the highly endothermic

Clinker is a nodular material which is produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement. It is used as a binder in many cement products. Clinker nodules are around 3-25 mm in diameter and dark grey in colour. Limestone and clay is heated to about 1400oC-1500oC in the rotary kiln to produce clinker.

Cement production is a highly energy-intensive process. Cement making consists of three major process steps : raw material preparation, clinker making in the kiln, and cement making. Raw material preparation and cement making are the main electricity-consuming processes, while the clinker kiln uses almost all the fuel in a typical cement plant.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

Of these models, the clinker calcination can be divided into preheating and pre-calcining, clinker sintering, and clinker cooling three stages. Clinker Production Processes & Necessary Machines. Step 1: preheating and pre-calcining. The preheating and pre-calcining of raw meal replace partial functions and shorten the length of the cement kiln.
