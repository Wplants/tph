Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.

The silica usually resides in soil, but sometimes it also can be found on plants or even inside humans' bodies. The human body contains around 2-5 g of silica while some adults may have more than that but have the same health benefit.
