Meanwhile, natural gas will account for 40 percent of the power supply, according to an analysis published Thursday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). US coal production has fallen by a third since its peak in 2008, according to official energy statistics, and more than half of all mines have closed since that time.

Oct 14, 2020More than 100 US coal plants were replaced or converted to run on natural gas between 2011 and 2019. As coal-plant operators seek ways to repurpose their old units to avoid them becoming stranded assets, conversion to natural gas has been a widely-adopted strategy in the US and is also favoured by Alberta, Canada-based TransAlta.

Mining Feature: Coal Mine Explosion Prevention. There are two main types of coalmine explosions: methane and coal dust. Methane explosions occur when a buildup of methane gas contacts a heat source and there is not enough air to dilute the gas level below its explosion point. Likewise, fine particles of coal dust in the right concentration that

Jun 25, 2022The problem isn't so much that natural gas plants are cheaper than coal anymore; it's that renewable energy has gotten cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels on price alone.  There are roughly 100,0000 workers directly employed by companies that mine coal or sell coal byproducts—down from nearly 300,000 workers in 2008.

## A US company is quietly building a massive coal-to-gas plant - in Indonesia
Jun 7, 2022Coal gasification is a century-old technology, but in recent years the coal industry has revived it as an alternative to natural gas and petroleum as part of efforts to rebrand coal as a carbon-neutral energy source. While most efforts to build coal-to-gas plants in the US have failed, the technology is widely used in China and South Africa - two major coal-producing countries - and it is

First, natural gas systems have fewer "moving parts" such as coal conveyors, crusher/dryers, etc. For this reason, the maintenance and manpower costs associated with the natural gas systems are less expensive than the coal systems. Second, projected fuel costs between coal and natural gas show that natural gas will remain cheaper per BTU

## Coal mine gas - GTP Solutions GmbH
Without an active degassing the mine gases are released into the atmosphere uncontrolled. Because coal mine gas can be transformed into electricity and heat, it is also economically viable to utilize this methane rich gas in modern combined heat and power plants. GTP plants make an effective and safe electricity- and heat-production possible.
