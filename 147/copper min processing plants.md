Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

For lower-grade deposits located near the surface, the open-pit method is the most practical for the mining of large tonnages of material. Large track-mounted drills prepare the ore for blasting, and the broken ore is hauled to the ore-dressing plant by truck (at up to 150 tons per load) or conveyor. In underground mining, vertical shafts are sunk well over 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) below the

Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.
