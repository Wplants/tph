## Energy Use in the Mining Industry - The World Counts
The energy used in mining does not come from wind or solar power. It comes from burning fossil fuels. The industry is among the largest sources of CO2 emissions. 27,966,078,388. Tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.  Iron ore; Mining uses some of the heaviest machinery on the planet. The largest of these machines can weigh up to 13,000
