Some of these properties are used as inputs to the pavement design process; others are assumed in deter- mining concrete thickness or are not considered in the design process (see chapter 5, Critical Properties of Concrete, page 105).

Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr

The comparable strength property was obtained for an aggregate made of 37.5% quarry dust and 62.5% activated fly ash. Hence, the aggregates with this proportion were used to prepare the concrete specimens. The concrete was cast by varying the coarse aggregate replacement ratio of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
