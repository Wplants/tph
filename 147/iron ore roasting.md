## Iron ore roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost need not apply
In order-ish, I didn't know of Jack Frost, just making a christmas song reference, I had about 75 lbs of ore before roasting, not sure now, feels lighter. Thinking about 3 ft tall and maybe around 16 inches i.d. for the furnace.

## US Patent for Autogenous roasting of iron ore Patent (Patent 
Iron ore concentrate is converted to magnetic gamma hematite in an autogenous roasting operation which is self-sustaining. The iron ore concentrate is preheated and contained magnetite is oxidized to hematite. Hematite is reduced to magnetite using carbon monoxide. After cooling, the magnetite is oxidatively exothermically converted to magnetic gamma hematite.

Roasting. Calcination is a process in which ore is heated in the absence of air or air might be supplied in a limited quantity. Roasting involves the heating of ore lower than its melting point in the presence of air or oxygen. Calcination involves the thermal decomposition of carbonate ores. Roasting is carried out mostly for sulfide minerals.

## Roasting (metallurgy)
Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas-solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

The object of calcining or roasting certain ores before treatment is to dissipate the sulphur or sulphides of arsenic, antimony, lead, etc., which are inimical to treatment, whether by ordinary mercuric amalgamation or lixiviation. The effect of the roasting is first to sublimate and drive off as fumes the sulphur and a proportion of the objectionable metals. What is left is either iron oxide

The most important operations are roasting, smelting, and refining. Roasting, or heating in air without fusion, transforms sulfide ores into oxides, the sulfur escaping as sulfur dioxide, a gas. Smelting ( q.v.) is the process used in blast furnaces to reduce iron ores. Tin, copper, and lead ores are also smelted.

Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world.
