## Effluents and residues from industrial sites for carbon dioxide capture 
5 days agoThe cement industry is one of the main contributors to the anthropogenic release of carbon dioxide, as it accounts for 5-7% of the overall emissions (Benhelal et al. 2013). The high levels of emissions are due to two main reasons: (1) producing of cement is an energy-intensive; (2) concrete is the building block of all modern constructions

## The cement mill - Understanding Cement
Cement manufacturing -brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.

Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

Second, industrialized (i.e. prefabricated (pre-cast) cement/concrete modules have significant potential to contribute to decreasing CO2 emissions: Industry experts estimate that pre-casting can reduce the amount of required cement by approximately 10% or more. Pre-cast modules require less concrete, and therefore less cement.

## Digitization and the future of the cement plant | McKinsey
Sep 16, 2020There's never been a more important time to build resilience into the core of the cement value chain: the cement plant. The cement industry is being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with global demand for cement expected to decline by 7 to 8 percent in 2020âthough these declines have been unevenly distributed across regions. 1 In response, cement players around the globe have reduced

Jan 1, 2021Now a days Cement plants are producing 75-80% PPC & 20-25% OPC due to high market demand of PPC. Production of PPC is cheaper and it's market rate is also lower than OPC by nearly 25 rupees per bag, so general consumer are attracted towards PPC cement. Cement companies also want to produce more and more PPC grade.
