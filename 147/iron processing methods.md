## USB2 - System and method for iron ore byproduct processing 
Processing byproduct material from a direct reduction process of iron ore to reclaim iron and other materials from the byproduct. The systems and methods employ gravity separation tables to separate the iron from other byproduct material constituents. The byproduct material constituents may be size reduced, processed to remove dust, and sized prior to processing by the gravity separation.

A bloomery is a type of metallurgical furnace once used widely for smelting iron from its oxides.The bloomery was the earliest form of smelter capable of smelting iron. Bloomeries produce a porous mass of iron and slag called a bloom.The mix of slag and iron in the bloom, termed sponge iron, is usually consolidated and further forged into wrought iron.

## Superalloy
A superalloy, or high-performance alloy, is an alloy with the ability to operate at a high fraction of its melting point. Several key characteristics of a superalloy are excellent mechanical strength, resistance to thermal creep deformation, good surface stability, and resistance to corrosion or oxidation.. The crystal structure is typically face-centered cubic (FCC) austenitic.

Jan 8, 2021Reduction of iron. In blast furnace, iron is not directly reduced from high valence oxide, but through a process of reduction from high valence oxide to low valence oxide, and then from low valence oxide to iron: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. The reduction of iron mainly depends on carbon monoxide gas and solid carbon as reducing agent.
