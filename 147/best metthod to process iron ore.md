## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron Ore - Item - WotLK Classic
Arathi is definetly the best place to go for iron ore. Obtained about 98 Iron, 14 Gold, 6 Silver, and 25 Tin, in about 2 hours. Dont forget to look in Bolderfist Hall, Bolderfist Outpost and the Drywhisker Gorge for extras along the way. And the Lake at Whiterbark Village normally has a few. Happy huntings :D
