It is thought that dicalcium phosphate may undergo molecular reorientation to form a non-crystalline amorphous calcium phosphate which acts as an intermediate in the process. Analysis of synthetic amorphous calcium phosphate indicates that it is composed of 1 nm diameter Ca 9 (PO 4 ) 6 clusters which close-pack randomly to form 30-80 nm spheres.
