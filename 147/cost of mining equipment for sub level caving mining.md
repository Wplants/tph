Caving methods are defined as those associated w ith induced, controlled, massive caving of the ore body, the overlying rock, or both. Th e exploitation workings in caving methods are designed to collapse, with intentional caving of the ore and/or host rock. The three major caving methods are: • Longwall mining • Sublevel caving

Sub-level caving is typically used where the orebody has a smaller footprint and/ or more competent rock mass that prevents the continuous caving required for a block cave. Blasting of the entire orebody is required to produce a production ore flow. As sub-level caving uses a 'top down' approach, it requires less upfront capital

Block caving requires a large amount of preparatory work, and before actual extraction of caved ore begins, considerable capital must be expended for this purpose. Thus, the estimated cost of preparatory work for a block containing 120,000 tons of ore at the Morenci Branch, Phelps Dodge Corporation, was $36,420.

Sub Level Caving. Mar 03, 2017 Experience from LKAB, Sweden - Sub-level caving SLC is an important mass mining method, used at LKAB. The caved rock or debris at the SLC interface reduces the fragmentation and the swelling of the blasted ring and it dissipates the explosive energy. These phenomena may immobilize the blasted ring, causing ore losses.

Description. This method is usually considered as an alternate to sublevel caving when a lower dilution method is needed and where the rock is fairly competent. The production for a mine using sublevel stoping can range from 15- 40 tons/employee-shift, while one stope can produce greater than 25000 tons per month.

Abstract: LKAB has been mining iron ore with the sublevel caving mining method in northern Sweden for more than 60 years. Throughout the years, LKAB has improved this mining method to stay competitive in a tough international iron ore market. Improvements in drilling and blasting technology have helped LKAB increase the scale of sublevel caving and therefore decrease its mining costs in
