The main beneficiation of tin ore is gravity separation because it has a higher density than symbiotic minerals. However, tin ore is often accompanied by iron oxide minerals such as magnetite and hematite, so it is impossible to completely separate the ore only by the gravity separation method. Therefore, the tin ore extraction method will also
