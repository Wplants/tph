## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

## 12 tips to maximize cone crusher productivity - Metso Outotec
Avoid trickle feeding the crusher. Try not to trickle feed a cone crusher. In addition to causing poor cone crusher productivity and product shape, trickle feeding has an impact on bearing alignment within said crusher. A crusher should be operated above 40% but below 100% rated horsepower in order to maximize cone crusher productivity and to
