## Pilot-Scale Plant to Extract Rare Earth Elements in Heart of Coal 
LEXINGTON, Ky. (Nov. 7, 2018) — Americans use rare earth elements (REEs) every day — without knowing it.In fact, they are crucial to society. Rick Honaker, professor of mining engineering at the University of Kentucky, knows all about these fascinating elements and the modern electronics they make possible.. REEs are a series of 17 chemical elements found in the Earth's crust.

## Boom in Mining Rare Earths Poses Mounting Toxic Risks
By Mike Ives • January 28, 2013. In November, the first shipment of raw "rare earth" minerals arrived at an $800 million processing plant on Malaysia's east coast near the home of Tan Bun Teet. The plant, run by Australia's Lynas Corporation, has since begun refining the rare earth metals, essential components in wind turbines, hybrid

Jul 14, 2022Jul 14, 2022 | Mining, News. A rendering of a fifty-one-stage demonstration plant. UCORE. Early evaluation of a process to separate rare earth elements (REE) from mined ore indicates a much smaller footprint is needed for the demonstration plant. Ucore Rare Metals, the Nova Scotia-based company developing the technology, says the finding puts

## Rare Earths co-development project in South Africa announced
Nov 4, 2020Sasol developed a comprehensive process flowsheet to extract the rare earths from the gypsum, which resulted in a successful pilot plant operation, producing c. 3 tonnes of mixed rare earth carbonate at c. 80% recoveries. Initial reports suggest low levels of radioactive elements like those seen at Rainbow's Gakara Project in Burundi.
