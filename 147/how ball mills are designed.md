## Ball Mill | Baking Processes | BAKERpedia
Ball mills can be designed as either batch or continuous equipment. In the latter case, the feed material flows steadily through the revolving shell. It enters at one end through a hollow drum and leaves at the other end through the drum or through peripheral openings in the shell.

Ball Mills. Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed system, with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers, such as screens

A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T
