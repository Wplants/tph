## coal mine amylase activity
Journal of Bacteriology and Parasitology. Amylase activity of different coal mine overburden spoil, as well as nearby NF samples were determined by spectrophotometric method (540 nm), in adaptation to the procedures described by Somogyi [68] and Roberge [69], by taking starch as substrate and incubated at 30Â°C for 24 hr. Invertase activity was estimated by using sucrose as substrate,

## Assay of Salivary Amylase enzyme activity - Biochemistry Den
Apr 29, 2022Salivary amylase is the enzyme produced by the salivary glands. Formerly known as ptyalin, it breaks down starch into maltose and isomaltose. Amylase, like other enzymes, works as a catalyst. This protocol is the basic laboratory procedure for the assay of salivary amylase activity. All catalysts are enzymes, but not all enzymes are catalysts.

## As steel demand rises, Virginia coal mining is on the upswing
Nov 12, 2021Among the factors contributing to the uptick in Virginia coal activity, Beakes pointed to the rising global demand for steel, a trade dispute between Australia and China that has led to greater U.S. export opportunities in the latter, and the $1.2 trillion federal infrastructure bill. "You cannot have infrastructure without steel," said Beakes.

Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

States. Methane emitted from active underground and surface coal mines, as wellas during postâmining activities, accounts for about 9% of all U.S. methane emissions. Another source of methane associated with coal mining is abandoned mine methane (AMM). As mines mature and coal seams are mined out, mines are closed and eventually abandoned.

## Determination of the Achromic Period of Salivary Amylase
In case of salivary amylase activity starch is substrate whereas maltose is the product.1. Starch +amylase =maltose. Starch+amylase+iodine=blue colour. The time taken by the reaction mixture to reach a point where no colour is formed is called achromic period. 2. So, the basic objective of this test is to determine the achromic period of
