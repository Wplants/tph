## Coal Mining in India - ClearIAS
Mar 29, 2022Coal mining was started during the rule of the East India Company in 1774 in the Raniganj coalfield along the western bank of the Damodar river.  All mitigation measures are to be taken up by coal companies, for which funds are earmarked in project reports/schemes/mine closure plans/revenue and capital budgets of respective projects.

Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
