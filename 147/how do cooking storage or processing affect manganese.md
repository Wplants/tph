## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.

## Manganese
Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. It improves strength, workability, and resistance to wear. Manganese oxide is used as an oxidising agent; as a rubber additive; and in glass making, fertilisers, and ceramics. Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide.

Smoking can either be done hot -- in a kiln or smokehouse for a short period -- or cold -- over low heat for up to 24 hours. Hot smoking preserves foods in three ways: Heat kills microbes; chemicals found in the smoke -- including formaldehyde and alcohols -- act as preservatives; and the food dries out so there is less moist area for bacteria

The stoichiometric amount of manganese needed to simply combine with the sulfur is 1.7 (%S). This means the ratio of manganese to sulfur in a manganese sulfide particle is 1.7. To assure that all sulfur present in gray iron forms manganese sulfide, another formula (equation 4) has evolved throughout the industry: Mn% = 1.7 (S%) + 0.3%.
