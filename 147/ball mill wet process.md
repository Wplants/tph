## Dry Ball Mill VS Wet Ball Mill: What Are the Differences and How to Choose?
Nov 13, 2020The wet ball mill has the following features: strong adaptability to materials, continuous production, large crushing ratio, easily fineness adjustment, high grinding efficiency, and low requirements for ore moisture content. In addition, the material transportation device is simple, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than dry ball mills.
