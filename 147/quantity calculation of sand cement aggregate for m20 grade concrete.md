Jun 29, 2022However, for volume batching, the materials are poured into prefabricated moulds, gauges, or farma's (Hindi). Since the aggregate and sand have a potential of developing pores or bulging, among other issues, the approach is not deemed to be entirely acceptable. As a result, the volume of the mix may rise but the correct ratio cannot be obtained.

## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand & Aggregate in M20, M15 
Oct 20, 2020Solution: In case of M 20 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 1.5 : 3. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete Ã 1.54 [ You can take this factor 1.54 to 1.57 ] Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 2 Ã 1.54 = 3.08 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio Ã· Sum of all ratio) Ã Total volume of

Here, M20 grade concrete ratio is 1:1.5:3 and if you sum up, ratio will be 5.5. Therefore, volume of column that is represented as V = 0.27 m 3 (meter cube). We get this volume from the specified 3 dimensions. Now, it is required to convert wet volume into dry volume. Apply the following formula to do this :-Wet Volume x 1.54 = 0.27 x 1.54 = 0.
