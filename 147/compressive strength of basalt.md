## compressive strength of basalt
The rock hardness of basalt is 6 on the Mohs scale, and can be seen through a combination of its compressive strength: Mpa (Megapascal), its tensile strength: 10-30 Mpa, and its shear strength: 20-60 Mpa, which denotes that depending on the mineral makeup, basalt rocks fall in the strong very strong category

The unconfined compressive strength refers to the peak stress in the static stress-strain curve. As shown in Figure 11, the unconfined compressive strength of cement-fly ash-stabilized soil increases first and decreases subsequently with the basalt fiber content varying in the range of 0% to 1.2%.

## Limits on strength and deformation properties of jointed basaltic rock 
Corresponding values for a basaltic rock mass that incorporate the weakening effects of scale are deformation modulus, 10-40 GPa; Poisson's ratio, 0.3; tensile strength, −0.1 to −2.5 MPa; uniaxial compressive strength, 10-90 MPa; and cohesion, 0.6-6 MPa. A measured deformation modulus for ambient pressure in the vertical direction, 20
