Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the 'Primary Crusher'. Cone crushers are typically used for 2 nd, 3 rd & 4 th stage crushing steps (although not always).
