## What is alluvial gold mining? | Socratic
Alluvial gold mining is the mining of stream bed deposits for minerals. Alluvial mining is frequently used for precious gold deposits which are often found in alluvial deposits i.e. in the sand and gravel of the river/stream beds. Alluvial gold deposits over a time when a river runs through ground that is rich in gold. The water erodes the surrounding rocks due to its comparative low density
