## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

## Manufacturing Sand | Agg-Net
Manufactured sand ranges from unprocessed quarry dust to carefully processed fine aggregate specifically designed for use in concrete. It may be gritty, flaky and full of filler or well shaped and graded, assisted, perhaps, by the nature of the parent rock, to produce well proportioned particles in the right size range.

## Classification of Aggregates based on Grain Size, Shape, Specific 
Mar 1, 20214.) Flaky Aggregates - The aggregate is said to be flaky when the least dimension of aggregate is less than 3/5th (or 60%) of its mean dimension. Mean dimension is the average size through which the particles pass and the sieve size on which these are retained. For example, mean size of the particles passing through 20 mm sieve and retained on 16 mm sieve is (20+16)/2=18 mm.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.

Coarse aggregate is the crushed rock used for cement concrete and bituminous concrete, having size of above 4.75 mm. In our crusher plant it is produced by impact action by HSI or VSI machine for imparting the cubical shape to aggregate.

The quality of the sand on cement, aggregate used in the concrete contributes to the strength properties and longevity of the concrete. Water, cement, and fine aggregates do not cause harmful impurities that adversely affect the properties of hardened cement and other admixtures used. Sand is one of the normal natural fines used in the manufacture of concrete.

Components of concrete are cement, sand, aggregates and water. Mixture of Portland cement and water is called as paste. So, concrete can be called as a mixture of paste, sand and aggregates. Sometimes rocks are used instead of aggregates. The cement paste coats the surface of the fine and coarse aggregates when mixed thoroughly and binds them.

Size, shape, texture play an important role in workability of concrete. With more surface area of sand, the demand for cement and water increases to bond the sand with coarse aggregates. The control over these physical properties of manufacturing sand make the concrete require less amount of water and provide higher workable concrete.
