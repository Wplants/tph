## Conveyor Drive: Feeder Drive for Rock Crusher/Pick Breaker Motors
The unloaded pick motor draws a low current that causes the controller to call for a maximum conveyor speed. As product is delivered to the conveyor inlet and up to the breaker section, pick/crusher motor current increases, reaching a trigger point at which the feeder conveyor drive begins to reduce conveyor speed.

## Crusher Hero Dictionary
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Because of the lower overall efficiency of the hydraulics system, compared to VFD/Mechanical drive, a larger HP electric motor is generally required for hydraulics. If VFD drive requires 150HP, hydraulics would typically use 200 t0 250 HP motor for the power unit. The difference in HP requirements has an impact on power consumption.
