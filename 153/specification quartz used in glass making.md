## Quartz Properties
Since electrical conductivity in fused quartz is ionic in nature, and alkali ions exist only as trace constituents, fused quartz is the preferred glass for electrical insulation and low loss dielectric properties. In general, the electrical insulating properties of clear fused quartz are superior to those of the opaque or translucent types.
