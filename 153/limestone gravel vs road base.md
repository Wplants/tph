## Limestone vs brick costr-ukraine.shop
The labor cost to lay brick is usually between $3 and $15 per sq. ft. In terms of hourly charges, skilled w orkers cost anywhere from $25 to $35 per hour. To give you an idea, a 1,000 sq. ft. wall would take an experienced worker around 100 hours to install bricks. This is equivalent to 10 sq. ft. per hour.
