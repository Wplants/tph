## Explained: Cement vs. concrete â their differences, and opportunities 
There's a lot the average person doesn't know about concrete. It's porous; it's the world's most-used material after water; and it's not cement. MIT's Concrete Sustainability Hub describes the world's most consumed construction material and its environmental impact.

## Stone dust vs sand for laying pavers? Help! - Houzz
The third uses washed concrete sand as the bedding base rather than stone dust. They all described similar excavation and prep compacting in 2" increments. All 3 of them use polymeric sand for the finish sweep. So I googled sand vs. stone dust and landed here. I still don't know for sure, but I think I am leaning towards the sand.
