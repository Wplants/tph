Gold Ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft, typically found in veins of 1 to 9, from y=0 to y=31 in all biomes, and in veins of one to nine from y=28 to y=80 within a badlands biome. The ore itself is dropped when mined with an iron pickaxe or better. It has little use in tools and armor, since the durability is very low. Gold Ore can be smelted in a (blast) furnace to make gold ingots
