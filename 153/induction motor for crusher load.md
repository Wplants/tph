## Why an Induction Motor is almost constant Speed Motor?
An induction motor always runs at speeds just below its synchronous speed. At no load the speed is closest to its synchronous speed. This running speed reduces further when loaded towards its full load capacity, to about 5% for a moderately rated machine to just more than 5% for smaller rated machine. The decreased speed of the motor with an increase of loading is insignificant, and, an
