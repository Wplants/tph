The Porphyry Copper Extraction Process Flowsheet Crushing Porphyry Copper Ores. Three stage crushing is illustrated in the flowsheet; however, it is possible and practical to eliminate the third stage by incorporating a rod mill in the grinding section. This is a very practical arrangement and often a necessity when handling wet, sticky ore.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

##  Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology - Princeton University
discovered that heat made copper more malle-able. Casting and smelting of copper began around B.C. (see figure 6-2). About 2500 B. C., copper was combined with tin to make bronze—an alloy that allowed stronger weapons and tools. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, probably was not developed until 300 A.D.

## How Extraction of Copper from Copper Pyrites? - QS Study
Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves the following steps - Crushing and concentration. The ore is crushed and then concentrated by froth floatation process. The ore obtained from mines are broken down into little piece by jaw crusher and then pulverized. The ore being sulphide ore is concentrated by froth floatation procedure.
