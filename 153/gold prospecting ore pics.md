## Finding gold ore ? - GOLD PROSPECTING - Nugget Shooter Forums
Nov 27, 2021I remember $50 per sample. I collected what I thought was a silver ore, but never sent the sample. For samples like that with "visible gold," I use a metal mortar and pestle. I crush it and put it on a 50 mesh sieve. I take the bigger stuff and crush it again. Finally, I pan it and see how much gold is in the sample.
