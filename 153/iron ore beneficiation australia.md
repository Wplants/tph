## Reducing the carbon intensity of the iron making value chain
Renewable options for powering beneficiation processes. Vining suggests that pairing up renewable energy sources like solar and wind farms with beneficiation and agglomeration activity can spur iron ore producers to consider further opportunities to reduce their downstream carbon footprint in the short term.

Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate. In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues. Based on the

## Proposed beneficiation of low-grade iron ore evokes mixed reaction from 
Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.
