## 5 Commonly Used Manganese Processing Methods | Mining Pedia
Jun 29, 2021The roasting of manganese carbonate ore is heating roasting, generally at 1000℃, and some up to 1150℃. The components in the ore generally do not melt or fuse, but only promote the decomposition of related components. To Wrap Up. The above is the basic processing methods for manganese ore.

## Manganese Beneficiation & Processing Technology in China
May 27, 2022The vast majority of manganese ores in China belong to lean ores, which must be beneficiated. However, most manganese ores are fine-grained, and there are a considerable number of high phosphorus ores, high iron ores, and CO (associated) beneficial metals, which brings great difficulty to beneficiation and processing.
