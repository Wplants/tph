## Mineral potential of the Russian Arctic: state and efficient 
Geological exploration of the Soviet Arctic and the mineral potential of its vast territory by the mid-1930s were covered in reports by G.G. Moor (1940), E.P. Moldovantsev and V.M. Sergievskii (1940), and other researchers at the XVII International Geological Congress (1937). V.A. Obruchev (1940) explored the northern part of this zone.

Icebreakers made the Arctic more accessible. When geological explorations reached beyond the Arctic Circle, it became clear how rich the Arctic coast was with mineral resources. The first commercial deposit of oil and gas in the Russian North—Chibyuskoye (currently in the Komi Republic)—was discovered in 1931; production started in 1939.
