## Tensile Strength of Concrete| What is Tensile Strength of Concrete 
Tensile Strength of Concrete. The range for the tensile strength of concrete is about 2.2 - 4.2 MPa. For low strength class concrete, as mentioned by Saber, the tensile strength of unreinforced concrete equals 1/10 the compressive strength, and for higher class, it is about 1/15.

## Tensile Strength Of Concrete Using Artificial Sand Crusher Diagram Jaw
Apr 01 2006 This paper describes about the investigation undertaken to examine the suitability of recycled concrete as a substitute for fine aggregate. Recycled concrete artificial sand is used for 40 of fine aggregate and natural sand is retained for the remaining part. HPC of M60 grade is attempted with different replacement levels of cement with Fumed Silica.

## Research and Application of High-Strength and High-Performance Concrete 
Although high-strength concrete has a higher tensile strength, it has a high elastic modulus, which will cause higher tensile stress under the same shrinkage and deformation, so the risk of cracking in the early stage and during use cannot be ignored.  Making artificial sand well is the core issue.

## How Does the Ratio of Sand to Cement Affect the Strength of Concrete 
C20 concrete would be considered a medium-strength concrete mix. Higher numbers indicate a stronger concrete.  In addition to the ratio, the type of sand that you use in the concrete mix also affects the strength of the concrete. Using unwashed beach sand, for instance, is likely to create a concrete mixture that is not as strong as products

## Concrete
Concrete is an artificial composite material,  Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. Sand, natural gravel, and crushed stone are used mainly for this  but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages; they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water.

## Tensile Strength of Concrete Test - Procedure - Civil Planets
Specimen - The concrete sample should have a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 150 mm and length 300mm. Range of Load - The testing machine can consistently apply the loads in the range of 1.2 MPa/min to 2.4 Mpa/min. Age of Test - The test shall be made at the period of 7 days and 28 days. Tests at any other age at which the tensile strength is desired may be made if so required.
