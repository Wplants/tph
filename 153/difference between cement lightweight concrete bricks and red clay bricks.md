Because concrete is more porous, cement bricks exhibit reversible expansion and contraction in the range of 3-6mm per 10m of walling. Clay bricks have a once off, permanent expansion after manufacture due to the firing process that extracts all moisture from the brick. This expansion is between 0 and 0.2%.

## What are the differences between AAC blocks and red bricks?
In terms of Performance: Lightweight - Autoclaved Aerated Concrete blocks are mostly 3 to 4 times lighter than red bricks making them cost-effective and easier to transport to the construction site. Fire resistance - Autoclaved Aerated Concrete blocks can offer fire resistance of up to 4 hours depending upon the thickness of the wall.

## Bricks And Clay - Do Concrete Bricks And Clay Bricks Differ?
Concrete Brick - average compressive strengths typically range from 3,000 to 4,000 psi. Clay brick units are 2 ½ to 3 times stronger than the concrete bricks. It is important to note that the strength of a brick or a concrete block or brick wall depends on the quality of the mortar holding the blocks together.
