Properties Of Washing and Separation Systems. Recoverable plastics coming from domestic waste end up mostly in landfills. Strong polymer chains in plastic are extremely resistant to natural bio degradation processes. Therefore landfills are overloaded with plastic wastes shortening lifespan of these landfills.

## Separation of Recyclable Waste: What Are the Applicable Techniques 
This technique uses air classifiers, cyclones, or cones for the separation of recyclable materials. The materials will be accelerated within a chamber where an upward air current will lift light items like plastics and paper out. Heavier elements like stones will be allowed to fall into a skip below. Spiral air flow action is thus commonly used

Finally the last step in the recyclable separation process is to press each type of waste into five by four feet bales and deliver them to the actual recycling machines or companies, that will recycle the materials and make them into new objects. This is how the recyclable separation machine works and how it makes the waste sorting process that much faster and efficient.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
