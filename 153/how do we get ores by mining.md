Today, the extraction of beryllium begins with the mining of raw materials (bertrandite ore and/or beryl ore). Beryl ore is melted in industrial furnaces, solidified and crushed, then treated with sulfuric acid to produce a water-soluble sulfate. Bertrandite ore is crushed, made into slurry and treated with sulfuric acid to form a sulfate.
