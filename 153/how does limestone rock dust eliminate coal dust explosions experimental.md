How Does Limestone Rock Dust Prevent Coal Dust . Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are pre­ vented by a generous application of rock dust (usually lime­ stone). If an explosion should occur, the rock dust disperses, mixes with the coal dust and prevents ﬂ ame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink.

## Coal dust
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverizing of coal. Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.. Grinding coal to dust before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning and makes the coal easier to handle.

Rock dusting (limestone dust) is a primary measure to prevent propagating coal dust explosions in underground coal mines in the United States. Although rock dust is considered a nuisance dust, Continuous Personal Dust Monitors (CPDMs) do not distinguish between the coal dust and rock dust and assess the total dust exposure.

Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. This rock dust serves to inert the coal dust when applied in the proper proportion.

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.
