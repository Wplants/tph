## Correct Rock Size For Jaw Crusher Feed
Effect Of Feed Rock Size Distribution On Crusher Performance. If the ore feed to any gyratory or jaw crusher consisted entirely of large cubes or spheres of a size that would just barely enter the crushing chamber the crusher could not be expected to produce anything like its normal rated capacity because the upper part of the crusher could not shatter the large pieces enough to keep the rest

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.

The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted. Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1.

Best suited for secondary crushing applications, cone crushers are designed to crush pre-sized materials, usually 100mm, 150mm or 200mm, depending on the size of the crusher. Cone crushers can form finished products down to 12mm or less. Like the jaw crusher, the cone crusher provides a relatively low cost crushing solution, but there are

A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

## Jaw Crushers - high quality and reliability from RETSCH
The crushing ratio of a jaw crusher results from the maximum achievable final fineness in relation to the maximum feed size. For Retsch jaw crushers, this lies between 12.5 and 220. A high value reflects the capacity of a jaw crusher to accept large sample pieces and provide powerful crushing performance, resulting in high final fineness.
