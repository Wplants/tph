The water causes the hardening of concrete through a process called hydration. Hydration is a chemical reaction in which the major compounds in cement form chemical bonds with water molecules and become hydrates or hydration products. Details of the hydration process are explored in the next section.

This reaction helps in forming calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Calcium oxide + carbon dioxide This process is known as decomposition. What happens when limestone is decomposed? When limestone is heated strongly, the calcium carbonate it contains absorbs heat (endothermic ) and decomposes to form calcium oxide.

Limestone. Some may believe limestone is a rocky outcropping of lime, but such is not the case. Lime is not readily to be found in nature. Limestone is not the oxide of calcium, but the carbonate of calcium, CaCO 3. It is actually the salt theoretically produced through the reaction of calcium and carbonic acid, H 2 CO 3.
