## Background - University of Newcastle
Iron Ore Beneficiation Beneficiation is concerned with recovering and concentrating the valuable ore from the run-of-mine feed, with different technologies applied to specific particle size ranges. Fine particles are usually well liberated, and thus have the potential to produce high grade concentrate.

Iron ore pellet, a key steelmaking raw material, is iron ore compressed into spheres. Pellet has higher iron content than fines and therefore commands a higher price.  "We have a 62 percent and a 63 percent iron (FE) content index so we can calculate the premium for 1 percent iron ore content any time," Gutemberg said.

The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

FUNDAMENTALS OF IRON ORE SINTERING R. P. Bhagat INTRODUCTION The process of sinter making originated from a need to make use of fines generated in mines and in ore benefiCiation plants. With the development of sintering technology, a sintering plant has become a tremendous success for providing a phenomenal increase in

## Beneficiation Methods of 5 Kinds of Iron Ore | Mining Pedia
Jun 28, 2022Common iron ores that worth to be beneficiated are magnetite, hematite, magnetite- hematite (siderite), limonite, siderite, composite iron ore, and the like. Iron ore beneficiation methods can be divided into two categories: single and combined. The single method mainly includes magnetic separation (weak magnetic separation, strong magnetic

Fine particles are usually well liberated, and thus have the Improved dewatering of iron ore fines by the use of , The washing of the iron ore fines results in a moisture of about 11-14% in the fines and about 4% in the sized ore. The moisture content goes up to 16-18% in the fines during the monsoon season.
