There are two main reasons, and both relate to cost. First, linear power supplies require large and expensive transformers. Second, the regulating transistor generates a lot of heat, which requires large and expensive heat sinks. For example, a 50V variable power supply set to output 5V at 2A might have (50V - 5V)  2A = 90W of heat to dissipate.
