## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

What is a combined grade? A combined grade (also known as a split class) includes students from two or more consecutive grades. For example, an elementary school may have a Grade 2/Grade 3 class combination or a Grade 7/Grade 8 class combination. In very small schools with few students, triple grade classrooms may occur, such as a Grade 1.
