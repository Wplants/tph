## what is meant by crushing strength of stone
Estimating compressive strength General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0)Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1)What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0 C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities, but many .

## What Is Meant By Crushing Strength Of Stone
Tests on Building Stones Crushing strength of the stone per unit area is the maximum load at which the sample crushes or fails divided by the area of the bearing face of the specimen Crystalline Test on Building StoStrength Strength is an important property to be looked into before selecting stone as building block Indian standard code recommends a minimum crushing strength of 3 5 N/mm 2 f
