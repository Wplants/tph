## Autoclaved aerated concrete
Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a lightweight, precast, foam concrete building material suitable for producing concrete masonry unit like blocks. Composed of quartz sand (SiO 2 with impurities), calcined calcium sulfate (or plaster of paris), lime (CaO), cement, water and aluminum powder, AAC products are cured under heat and pressure in an autoclave.

Cement acts as the binder between aggregates (fine and coarse rocks) in the formation of concrete. While cement makes up only a small percentage of the mix (approximately 12 percent by volume), it is almost exclusively responsible for the resulting CO 2 emissions. In the cement-manufacturing process, raw materials are heated to high temperatures in a kiln in a fuel-intensive process known as

Modern, dry-process cement plants with efficient configuration of grinding and pyro processing systems typically consume less than 700 kcal/kg-cl thermal energy and 100 kWh/mt of electrical energy. Older plants have inefficient systems, which compounded with operational and maintenance inadequacies, tend to have much higher energy consumption.

## Cement manufacturing - components of a cement plant
Summary of production process. Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of

## Cement & Concrete
In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates. The paste, composed of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine and coarse aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete. Within this process lies the key to a
