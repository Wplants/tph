Aug 31, 2022All the above work has largely been funded by monies made available from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMRCA) of 1977. This imposed a levy of 28 cents per tonne on present day coal production. This went to the Federal Government, which sent 50% back to states with AML programmes. But there was a flaw.

Coal mining has been common in the United States for nearly two centuries. Prior to the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977, there was no regulatory oversight of coal operators or what happened to mines after mining stopped. As a result, millions of Americans live less than a mile from an abandoned coal mine.
