## Quartz Stone Manufacturing Process: Everything You Need to Know
Engineered quartz is also popularly called re-composed or reconstituted stone. The manufacturing process involves a mixture of quartz aggregated chips pigments, additives, and resin binders. Engineered quartz stone for slab and countertop applications come in a wide array of colors, textures, and patterns.

## Is Quartz Sustainable? An Honest Look at the Facts
The bigger concern for quartz comes during the manufacturing process. During the production of quartz, small crystalline dust is spread into the air. This is called silica.  Floor tiles; Wall tiles; Backsplashes; Quartzite has more limited color variations, and it is typically white and gray. Its hardness and durability is comparable to

Dec 9, 2021Molding into shape: The next step in the process of what are quartz countertops made of is pouring the mixture into molds. All the raw materials, once combined, form a texture similar to wet sand. This is poured into huge molds to shape the quartz into slabs. The mixture is distributed evenly to ensure a perfectly flat piece of slab.
