## Cement Crusher - Crusher In Cement Plant | AGICO Cement
Raw materials of the cement plant are mostly from open-pit mines, and the ore size of large mines can reach 1.5-1.8m. In the preparation of cement raw materials, we first need to crush limestone, gypsum, clay and other materials into proper size to facilitate the subsequent transportation and storage, at the same time make full preparations for the next process (cement raw materials grinding).
