## gold recovery by ion exchange resin in europe
Jan 01, 2016· Application of ion-exchange resins to the recovery of gold is described. Significant developments around gold-selective anion-exchange resins and the commercialization of at least two of these products have made resin-in-pulp (RIP) available as an alternative to CIP for the upgrading of gold from cyanided pulps.

Ion exchange resin is composed of organic polymers that forms a network of hydrocarbons, and ion exchange sites, called"functional group" throughout the matrix. So, The ion exchange sites attract ions of an opposing charge, which give the ion exchange resin its

## Gold recovery with ion exchange used resins - ScienceDirect
The aim is to develop a fixed bed system using ion exchange exhausted resins from a water demineralizing system to treat gold electroplating effluents. The resins come from the three bed demineralizing station for water supply to an industrial oil plant. The first bed in the station is filled with a strong acid cationic resin of the gel type
