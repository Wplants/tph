## Crushers and Their Types - IspatGuru
Types of crushers. Crushers are classified into three types based upon the stage of crushing they accomplish. These are (i) primary crusher, (ii) secondary crusher, and (iii) tertiary crusher. The primary crusher receives material directly from run of mine (ROM) after blasting and produces the first reduction in size.

## Primary And Secondary Crushing Crushers
What Is Primary Secondary and Tertiary Crushing Eagle. Jul 10, 2020 But when a wider variety of product is desired and certain material is being processed, like concrete and asphalt, it can be valuable to rely on additional stages of crushing, like secondary and tertiary. Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material

## Secondary & Tertiary Crushing Circuits - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
This one involves both SECONDARY and TERTIARY crushing. This circuit is employed where either the tonnage or the work index of the ore is high enough to require that the crushing be done in stages. Again the ore will come from a Primary crusher and be scalped. The coarse material will be crushed by the secondary crusher.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing - Eastman Rock Crusher
The picture above shows an example of how the crushing plant can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. The aggregate produced in a primary crusher is classified using a screen into a 0-20 mm fraction and typically a 20-150 mm fraction. The 0-20 mm fraction contains soil etc. and is generally considered to be of poor quality.

## difference in primary and secondary crushing
The output of the primary crusher is fed to a secondary crusher, which further reduces the size of the material. similarly the output of secondary crusher is fed to the tertiary crusher which reduces the material size further. some of the materials may pass through four or more of the crushing stages before it is reduced to the desired size.
