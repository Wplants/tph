In 2017, mining contributed R334.7 billion or 8 percent to gross domestic product from R306.2 billion in 2016 an increase of R28.4 billion. The increase in production and value addition by mining can be attributed to the recovery in prices of commodities. The improved commodity prices brought the mining industry back into profitability.
