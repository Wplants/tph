Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

## Phosphate Rock - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Production requires first the beneficiation of the ore, followed by acid leaching and separation.  Phosphogypsum is a waste by-product from the processing of phosphate rock in plants producing phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers, such as superphosphate. The wet chemical phosphoric acid treatment process, or 'wet process', in which
