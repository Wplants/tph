## Low-Cost Housing: A Sustainable Solution for the 21st Century
Modular Stack by Kasita. Modular buildings are another trend that helps make low-cost homes. This technology involves the use of predetermined designs and materials to fabricate buildings off-site. Then a team assembles the pieces on site. This method can accelerate construction speed and reduce costs by about 20%.

## Low Cost Housing - Civil Engineering Portal
Building Cost. The building construction cost can be divided into two parts namely: Building material cost : 65 to 70 %. Labour cost : 65 to 70 %. Now in low cost housing, building material cost is less because we make use of the locally available materials and also the labour cost can be reduced by properly making the time schedule of our work.
