Jul 22, 20213. Remove iron stains with a high pressure water tool. Most iron stains can be removed with a high pressure water gun. Simply shoot the water spray at the quartz crystal and watch the stains disappear. This will work for most iron stains on your quartz, leaving only some slight staining in the cracks of the crystal.

I know hydrofluoric acid dissolves quartz, but I'm afraid that it'd take the crystal with it. I did a google search on getting gems from host rocks, but youtube and google seem to be empty on the topic. I found a line that after the rock is milled, it is spun around in a water solution and then that will erode the stone and leave the gem.

Rock cuts along highways and parking lots are a great place to look for fossils. These rock faces show many, many years of fossil records and distinct periods as well as anomalies. Disturbed areas can hide a great deal of fossils. Quarries, man-made ponds and erosion-prone areas are ideal for fossil hunting.

If you've found a quartz crystal on the ground and there are no visible rock outcrops in the area from which it may have come, you should start to do some digging. You can also start to dig some exploratory holes slightly uphill from where you found your crystal. Dig about 2′ deep and see what you find, if anything.
