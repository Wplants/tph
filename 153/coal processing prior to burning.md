## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
After undergoing a cleansing process, coal is typically burned in order to produce electricity. The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways.
