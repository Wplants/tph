Underground soft-rock mining is a group of underground mining techniques used to extract coal, oil shale, potash, and other minerals or geological materials from sedimentary ("soft") rocks. Because deposits in sedimentary rocks are commonly layered and relatively less hard, the mining methods used differ from those used to mine deposits in igneous or metamorphic rocks (see underground hard

As already mentioned, slate has been extracted from slate quarries in the South West of England and Wales for many centuries. Slate was used when building parts of some of the Roman forts in England and Wales. The first-ever slate roof was thought to be located in North Wales around 1300 AD. However, the use of slate didn't really explode

About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

Marine mining involves extracting diamonds from the seabed, deep under water.

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining
Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

Jun 02, 2021 Slate is the lowest grade of metamorphic rock, put under pressure beneath the earth some 500 million years ago. It consists chiefly of quartz, clay, chlorite, mica, feldspar, and pyrite. As it cooks within the earth's crust, the clay reverts to mica and develops a "slaty cleavage"‚Äîmeaning it can be split into thin layers.

## Slate
Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism.It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock. Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.
