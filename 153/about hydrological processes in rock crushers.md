## Rock fragments and soil hydrological processes: Significance and 
The differences in effects on soil hydrological processes are also dependent on the position of rock fragments (Brakensiek and Rawls, 1994).Rock fragments that rest on the soil surface and in the soil profile characterize the positions of rock fragments, which likely affects soil physical properties (van Wesemael et al., 2000).In addition to protection of soil surfaces by rock fragments (Wang

## What is hydrologic cycle and what are its processes? - BYJUS
The following are the important processes of hydrologic cycle: Evaporation: Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapour. Condensation: Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase, and is the reverse of vaporization.

The hydrological cycle is also called the water cycle, the global water cycle or the hydrologic cycle.It explains the water-cycling mechanism through the earth's biosphere. The physical state of water has three phases, namely solid (glaciers, ice sheets etc.), liquid (oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds etc.) and gas (water vapours).. The water cycle has four significant processes like evaporation

In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

A hydrological process is the cycle of Water Travelling from Land to ground in a constant Rotation. Within the Hydrological Process there are three main components which are Evaporation, Condensation and Precipitation. Evaporation: The water uses heat from the sun to turn from liquid to gas.
