Concrete mixtures were prepared using different proportions of copper slag as partial and full replacement of fine aggregate. The percentage of copper slag added by weight ranged between 10- 100% of sand used in concrete. For each concrete mixture, six 150mmx150mmx150mm cubes, three 300mmx150mm dia. cylinders and three 100mmx100mmx500mm prisms

## Use of Copper Slag as Fine Aggregate in Concrete: A review
In India, there is large demand of aggregates mainly from civil engineering industry for the construction of road and concrete. But now a days, it is very difficult problem for available for fine aggregate. The construction industry is the only area where the safe use of waste material (Copper Slag) is possible. Various studies have been conducted to reduce effect on environment, reduce cost

The effect of copper slag addition as replacement of fine aggregate on the density of normal and high strength concretes is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that there is general increase in the density of both normal and high strength concretes with the increase of copper slag replacement in the concrete.

## Concrete mix design using copper slag as fine aggregate - SlideShare
Here the potential use of granulated copper slag, a relatively heavy material, as a replacement to sand in concrete mixes is explored. The effect of replacing fine aggregate by copper slag on the compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength of concrete are studied in this work. The proposed mix design method was found to

## Life-Cycle Assessment of High-Strength Concrete Mixtures with Copper 
2. Copper Slag (CS) as Fine Aggregate Substitute in Concrete. A number of criteria are relevant in the selection of alternative materials that can be substituted for aggregates in concrete applications, including (1) low cost, (2) compatibility with other constituents of concrete, and (3) compatibility with concrete design properties . Based on
