## Can Sea Sand be Used for Concrete Construction? | Quarrying & Aggregates
Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.

5 days agoThe so-called particle gradation mainly refers to the situation where sand particles with different particle sizes are matched with each other. If the sand aggregate has a good particle gradation and a low gap ratio, it is beneficial to adjust the performance of admixtures and improve the performance of concrete.

Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit, river, lake, or seabed. Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete.

Pour concrete over a solid, well-drained base. Because concrete slabs "float" on the soil, soft ground or voids underneath may cause unsupported areas to crack under heavy weight like vehicles. Pack about 4 in. of sand or gravel over clay and other poorly draining soils to provide even support.

## Using Recycled Concrete Aggregate | Specify Concrete
Crushed concrete has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first, since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

Jun 30, 2021Typically, a diameter range of 9.5mm to 37.5mm is used. Fine aggregates are often sand or crushed stone with a diameter of less than 9.55mm. The most often utilized aggregate size in construction is typically 20mm. In mass concrete, a greater size, 40mm, is more frequent. Larger aggregate sizes use less cement and water.
