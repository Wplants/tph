## Key Factors in Rotary Kiln Shell Design - AGICO Cement Plant
The length of each part of a rotary kiln is designed based on the inner diameter (D) of the kiln shell. 1) The length of the kiln head overhanging section (l1): l1= (1.2~1.5) D. As the first section of a rotary kiln, l 1 is better not to be designed too long, or the length of the effective parts of the kiln will have to be shortened.

## How Cement Is Made in Rotary Kiln | Rotary Kiln Manufacturer
How Cement Is Made in A Rotary Kiln. Originally, when the process was first developed, manufacturers used the "wet kiln" process. This involved pouring in a slurry of clay, limestone, and water. While the process was easy to set up, it required an absolutely enormous rotary kiln to be effective - at least 200 meters long.

To make cement, raw materials such as limestone, cement rock, sand, iron ore, clay and shale are crushed, blended and fed into a kiln. These materials are then heated in the kiln to temperatures above 2900°F to initiate a chemical reaction (called "fusion") that produces cement "clinker," a round, marble-sized, glass-hard material.

Clinker storage capacity can be based on the market, and a cement plant usually stores 5-25% of the annual clinker production.

In the semidry process the raw materials, in the form of nodules containing 10 to 15 percent water, are fed onto a traveling chain grate before passing to the shorter rotary kiln. Hot gases coming from the kiln are sucked through the raw nodules on the grate, preheating the nodules. Dust emission from cement kilns can be a serious nuisance.

The makeup of a kiln. During the operation of the rotary kiln, flames can reach temperatures as high as 1900°C (3452°F) in order to heat raw materials to roughly 1500°C (2732°F). As a result, these materials become partially molten and undergo a series of physical and chemical reactions to become the primary constituent of cement.
