## The Facts on Cadmium | Dartmouth Toxic Metals
Humans play a significant role in creating concentrated sources of cadmium and releasing it into the environment through activities such as mining, smelting and refining metal ores â€” particularly zinc, lead and copper. Cadmium is also emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning, waste incineration and steel production.

##  Mineral Commodity Profiles: Cadmium - Usgs
Cadmium is a soft, low-melting-point metal that has many uses. It is similar in abundance to antimony and bismuth and is the 63d element in order of crustal abundance. Cadmium is associated in nature with zinc (and, less closely, with lead and copper) and is extracted mainly as a byproduct of the mining and processing of zinc.

## Cadmium poisoning: causes and symptoms - Blog - Everlywell
Cadmium is a metal that appears soft, malleable, and bluish-white in its elemental form. While it is a relatively widespread element, it is rarely found on its own as a pure metal and more often forms complex compounds in zinc ores. It is mainly produced through the process of smelting, mining, and refining zinc, lead, and copper.

## Cadmium | History, Uses, Facts, Physical & Chemical Characteristics
Cadmium is a rare metal. The concentration of cadmium on the Earth is around 0.5 ppm (parts per million). Mostly it is present in the form of ores of zinc and sulfide. The sulfide ore of cadmium is termed as greenockite (CdS). Currently, cadmium is obtained from the mining, smelting and purification of ores of zinc sulfide, and copper sulfide.

Cadmium Used by Van Gogh, Edison and Junger. Cadmium is present throughout the environment and is naturally occurring in both the Earth's water and crust. It was first isolated in Germany in 1817 as a by-product of zinc refining. It found use in the 1850's as a pigment used in paintings because of its brilliant yellow, orange, and red colours.

## Environmental and human health risks from cadmium exposure  - PubMed
Cadmium (Cd) contamination from mining and smelting operations has led to growing environmental health concerns. In this study, soil, surface water, drinking water, rice, vegetables, and biomarkers (hair and urine) were collected from local residents near an active lead-zinc mine and a copper smelter.
