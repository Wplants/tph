1 Stamps. Stamps were used in California gold mines around 1850. First developed in England and used by Cornish miners, stamps were heavy iron machines used to pound rocks containing gold quartz into a fine dust so the gold ore could be extracted. Small stamps were commonly powered by water wheels while larger ones ran by steam engines.

Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? « Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ». The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides - also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

## Three Rocks that Contain Gold - Rock and Mineral Planet
Dec 20, 2021Conclusion. All three types of rocks can contain gold; Sedimentary, Metamorphic, and Igneous. The most commonly known rock to contain gold is quartz rock and this is due to the visibility of the gold within the rock. Many of the other rocks will not have such visibility of their gold contents. The only way to know if it is gold bearing is to

Take a rock that contains gold in it - this process works best on quartz rocks - and set it inside a Limestone jar. Add white cooking vinegar to the jar, covering the entire rock and then some with the vinegar. The acid-based vinegar slowly dissolves the quartz crystals surrounding the gold, leaving only bits of quartz attached to the gold

Answer (1 of 12): No they do not. Quartz is common, gold is rare. Quartz veins typically form when very hot water rising from depth flows into a shallow crack in the rock. The dissolved silica precipitates as quartz. If there is gold present in the water, it will also precipitate. The result is
