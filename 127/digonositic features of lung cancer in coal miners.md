Over the years, CWP has been typically diagnosed in a coal miner who has had considerable dust exposure accompanied by compatible chest radiographical findings. 2 The latency period is usually more than 10 years, although it has been reported for miners working as few as 6 years in Vietnam. 17 The recent trend of a longer latency in China may

## Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung Disease)
Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), commonly known as "black lung disease," occurs when coal dust is inhaled. Over time, continued exposure to the coal dust causes scarring in the lungs, impairing your ability to breathe. Considered an occupational lung disease, it is most common among coal miners.

## Comparison of lung cancer risk in black-coal miners based on  - PubMed
Background: Cancer risk (especially as regards lung cancer) in black-coal miners is mainly analyzed on the basis of mortality. The risk calculated based on mortality may differ from the values based on incidence. The aim of the study was to compare cancer risk in black-coal miners with and without coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), based on data on mortality and the incidence of lung cancer

## Population Cancer Risks Associated with Coal Mining: A  - PLOS
Background Coal is produced across 25 states and provides 42% of US energy. With production expected to increase 7.6% by 2035, proximate populations remain at risk of exposure to carcinogenic coal products such as silica dust and organic compounds. It is unclear if population exposure is associated with increased risk, or even which cancers have been studied in this regard. Methods We
