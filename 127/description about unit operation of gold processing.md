## Principles of unit operations in food processing - Quantitative 
Each one of those operations is called a 'unit operation', being common in many industrial processes. Although being widely different and specific, all unit operations can be simplified into three kinds of phenomena, involving momentum, heat, and mass transfer. The rheological characterization of food is important for the design of unit

## Principles of Unit Operations in Food Processing
Unit operations imply a set of methods used during food processing. This article will cover some of the unit operations involved in the food industry including raw materials handling, cleaning, separating, disintegrating, forming, pumping, and mixing. Besides these seven operations, there are other unit operations like application methods

## Unit Operation and Unit Process - Chemical Engineering World
The concept of unit operations was introduced in 1915 by Dr. Arthur D. Little. The concept of unit processes was introduced in 1923 by P.H. Groggin. Unit Operations. A unit operation is defined as a process which does not involve any chemical reaction. Unit operations only deal with physical changes of the materials involved in the process.
