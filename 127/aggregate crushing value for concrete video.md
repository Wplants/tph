Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate
