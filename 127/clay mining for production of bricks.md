Accessories from The Brick Tile Company allow you to complete the job to a professional standard, starting with a primer coat to prepare plasterboard walls for the tiles. Brick tile adhesive, tile spacers and tile mortar help you finish the installation of the brick slips with an authentic mortar grouting effect.

## Recycling mining and construction wastes as temper in clay bricks 
Materials consist of a plastic clay used by a brickwork and four residues from mining and construction, all from Calabria, Italy. The clay (named B) is a typical argillaceous marl, excavated in Settingiano, and utilized mainly in the production of paving bricks and roof tiles.

## Old clay bricks
Bricks Step 1 Examine the surface of the brick . Old bricks were formed by hand, so look for irregularities in shape. They should be slightly uneven and may contain straw. These older hand-shaped bricks are larger than the bricks made today, although never larger than a hand width. Step 2 Look for an indentation on the brick's surface.

Then the clay or shale mixtures are transported to plant storage areas (see Photo 1). Continuous brick production regardless of weather conditions is ensured by storing sufficient quantities of raw materials required for many days of plant operation. Normally, several storage areas (one for each source) are used to facilitate blending of the clays.

Some mining and petrochemical production is more cost-effective when integrated within a chemical company. Energy and feedstock costs are often a significant expense for chemical companies.

## Composition of Bricks - Function of Ingredients - Civil Engineering
Bricks should contain a little amount of finely powdered lime. It enables silica (of a required portion) to melt at the furnace temperature of 1650 o C and binds the particles of brick together resulting in strong and durable bricks. At about 1100 o C, lime acts as a catalyst to elevate the furnace temperature to 1650 o C at which silica fuses.
