The aim of this paper was to study the transitional phenomena between cascading, cataracting and centrifuging motion. In order to observe these transitions, experiments were carried out in a tumbling mill of 300 mm diameter, and three sizes of chrome steel balls were used as grinding media. Each size of ball was employed in three different

## Validation of tumbling mill charge-induced torque as predicted by 
Understanding mill charge motion is important. In the charge, the center of gravity is shifted from the rotational center of the mill system, and its motion is induced by rotation of the mill. At the same time, the charge creates a torque in the mill system. Breakage of ore particles and wear of liners/ball media are closely linked to this motion. To study these phenomena in a physically

The motion of the charge, that is the grinding media and the material undergoing grinding, within a mill is of considerable theoretical interest and practical importance, and for these reasons, has been the subject of considerable study by a number of workers, but, even so, no rigid and complete theory, covering all the aspects of the dynamics of the mill charge, has yet been produced.

Autogenous grinding is at present carried out in tumbling mills of the same types as used in ball mill grinding. The similarities in equipment and procedure have led to the commonly held assumption that the grinding mechanisms are the same in the two processes, with the coarse part of the ore charge taking over the function of the ball charge.

## motion of charge in tumbling mill
How Ball Mills Lifter Bar Affects Charge Motion. Aug 08, 2018· The performance of a ball mill is known to be affected by the design of the liners. A proper liner must key the ball charge to the mill shell in order to maximize the tumbling action with a minimum of slippage, and at the same time it must protect the mill shell from damage.

## How Ball Mills Lifter Bar Affects Charge Motion
The performance of a ball mill is known to be affected by the design of the liners. A proper liner must key the ball charge to the mill shell in order to maximize the tumbling action with a minimum of slippage, and at the same time it must protect the mill shell from damage. There are two important features that are common to all three figures.
