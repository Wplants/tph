## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Toggle Plate | Genuine Alternative Jaw Crusher Parts | GTEK
Toggle Plate is a simple & low-cost but very important part of jaw crusher. It is usually made of cast iron, and it is used to hold the lower part of the jaw in position, it also serves as a safety mechanism for the entire jaw. If something that the jaw crusher cannot crush gets into the crushing chamber accidentally and it cannot pass through

## Jaw Crusher Liner Plate Design & Profile Shapes
These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.
