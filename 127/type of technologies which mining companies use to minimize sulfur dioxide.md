Texas at times has produced more than 90 percent of the nation's sulfur. In 1954 Texas sulfur production by the Frasch process amounted to 3,450,000 long tons valued at $75,100,000. In addition, sulfur was also being recovered from sour gas. In the 1960s, exclusive of the oil-gas group, sulfur was the state's most valuable mineral.

In 1986, the FDA banned sulfites — which contain sulfur dioxide — from being used in fresh fruits and vegetables after it caused health issues in people with asthma. Sulfur dioxide, however, is still used in many foods including dried fruits, processed meats like hot dogs and even some baked goods.
