The construction and demolition waste aggregates are classified by BS 8500 (2002). The code classifies this into two types as: The concrete aggregate that contains 95% of crushed concrete is called as recycled concrete aggregates. And if the aggregate used in the concrete is 100% crushed, it is called as recycled aggregates.

History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

## Recycled Aggregates | Boral
A recycled granular material processed from deposits of sand, gravel, rock or demolition concrete. Aggregates are a versatile material which are suitable for a variety of applications such as use in concrete and asphalt production, and drainage projects. In order to maximise natural rock and promote environmental sustainability, recycled aggregates are produced from recycled materials which

## What Are Recycled Aggregates and How Are They Used?
What is Recycled Aggregate? Any type of material that has been used in construction has some sort of waste. For example, sand, gravel, stone, and asphalt are all used in construction but they may be left over. In the past, these extras would be dumped in the landfill, making a bigger problem for waste processors.

Eco-Friendly. Recycled Aggregate is regarded to be a 'green' construction material. Using recycled aggregate reduces the amount of virgin aggregates which are created and therefore means less use of natural resources.

Therefore, this would reduce the carbon footprint of quarrying virgin aggregates. Different batches of concrete with ratios of 25%, 50% and 75% recycled material will replace the virgin aggregate. The maximum and minimum quantity of recycled aggregate required for an ideal concrete mix design can then be obtained.

## Recycled Aggregate Concrete: Applications, Advantages  - Happho
Disadvantages of Recycled Aggregate. Downgrading of quality of concrete. Increase in water absorption capacity ranging from 3% to 9%. Decrease in compressive strength of concrete (10-30%) Reduces workability of concrete. Lack of specifications and guidelines. Less durability of RAC, however few papers have shown an improvement in the durability
