## What is Conveyor System and its Types? Definition, Need, Selection
The basic usage of any conveyor system is for the movement of material through conveying or feeding. In this conveying is the movement of materials from one specific point to other drop points. These three things are considered to pick up and drop points, and the time is taken to convey the materials.

A heavy-duty conveyor system consists of a carrying surface (usually a multiplied heavy duty conveyor belt), a support structure, and a drive pulley. Unlike most lightweight conveyor systems, heavy duty systems need an end and take-up pulley. Heavy duty systems are easily recognized by their heavy construction and idler belt support units

Types of Conveyors and Conveyor Systems. Conveyors can be broken down into two major categories - gravity or powered conveyors. Gravity conveyors rely on the force of gravity, typically through elevation changes, to move the product along the length of the conveyor. Gravity roller, wheel and chute are the three basic types of these conveyors.
