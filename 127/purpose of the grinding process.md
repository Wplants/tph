Grinding Wheel. In the grinding process, an emery or corundum wheel is used as the cutting tool. Emery and corundum are naturally found abrasives and are impure forms of aluminium oxide Al 2 O 3.A grinding wheel is made up of thousands of tiny abrasive particles embedded in a matrix called the 'bond' An abrasive is an extremely hard material second in hardness only to diamond.

Grinding force ratio is a parameter that gives indirect information about the efficiency of grinding. Force ratio is defined as: (2.8) When grinding with sharp wheels grinding force ratio is high since normal force is low compared to tangential force. Conversely, when grinding with blunt wheels grinding force ratio is low.

The wet grinding process occurs when a product is transformed from solid to liquid, regardless of its viscosity: paints, inks, enamels, nail varnish, among others. In this process, agglomerates that were not separated in the dispersion phase (due to the electro-physical bonding of some components) are broken by applying extra energy..

Grinding. Grinding is a machining process used to improve surface finish, cut hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical part surfaces by removing a very small amount of material. While the grinding process has been vastly improved upon with the addition of CNC, it is still a very slow way to remove stock from a part.
