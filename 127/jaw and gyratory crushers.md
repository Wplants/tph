Blake's crusher was announced in 1857 and patented in 1858. Perhaps surprisingly, the same basic design is still in use today for rock crushers. In the years following the design of the Blake Jaw Crusher, another type of crusher was designed. A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881.
