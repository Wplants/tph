The iron ore fines and flux materials were mixed along with 0.5 % bentonite in a rotary cone mixer. The mixture was then pelletized with intermittent manual spray of water (7-9 %) for nucleation and growth of pellets in a disc pelletizer having 700 mm disc diameter (30 rpm speed). The pellet size was maintained between +8 and −15 mm.

Pellets: the process of pelletization enables converting Iron Ore Fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets" that can be charged into the blast furnaces or for Production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). Pellets are uniform size, with purity of 63%- 65% contributing to faster reduction and high metallization rates.

## Effect of limestone and dolomite flux on the quality of pellets using 
The particle size distribution of the iron ore fines is presented in Fig. 1. It indicates that more than 65% of the particles are below 45 μm. Blaine number of iron ore fines was measured as 2920/cm 2.g −1. It illustrates that the particle size distribution and fineness of the iron ore fines satisfy the pelletization criteria.
