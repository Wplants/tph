## stone in church and cathedral construction - abelard
Church buildings are generally made of stone, the solid and usually stable building material. Stone is strong in compression, but if it has a grain, this strength is compromised if the weight of the building presses down against the grain of the stone, so creating stress. This is particularly significant when using limestone.

Expert Answer. Natural stone, such as sandstone, is a popular building construction material. An experiment was carried out in order to better understand the decay properties of sandstone when exposed to the weather. Blocks of sandstone were cut into 300 equal-sized slices and the slices randomly divided into three groups of 100 slices each.
