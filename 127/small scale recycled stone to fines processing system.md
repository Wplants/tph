A simple definition of glass recycling is the reprocessing of used glass to form new glass 1. The glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called cullet. Glass can also be recycled through crushing and integration into roadway materials or reprocessing into foam glass. Glass bottles can also be cleaned and reused and repurposed.

## Exploring small-scale recycled mantle components with intraplate 
1. Introduction. Subducted slabs stored in the mantle can be recycled back to the surface via mantle upwelling resulting in intraplate volcanoes (Hofmann and White, 1982).The most intensively studied intraplate volcanic system on Earth is that of Hawaii, where the system results from the melting of a deeply rooted mantle plume.
