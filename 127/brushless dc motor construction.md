## Brushless DC Motor : 6 Steps (with Pictures) - Instructables
Step 1: DIY Rotor. The spinning part of an electric motor is called the rotor. Most brushless motors have permanent magnets on the rotor. Our rotor spins thanks to a 608ZZ bearing stuck on a pencil. This bearing is commonly used in things like skateboard wheels and fidget spinners. We stuck two 1/4" x 1/4" x 1/8" B442 neodymium magnets on the

## What is a Brushless DC Motor Construction?
The brushless DC (BLDC) motor is a type of the synchronous electric motor. In other words, the rotating speed of the electric motor's rotor is subject to the impact of the speed of the stator's rotating magnetic field and the number of the stator's poles (p), namely n=60.f/p. When the number of the stator's poles is fixed, change of the
