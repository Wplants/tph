## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

Open Pit Mining. After identifying the potential source of bitumen, the area is cleaned and overburden is removed to ensure the smooth and continuous recovery of oil sands. Once the land is cleaned, it is ready to mine. The first step is to collect the oil sands ore from the ground and transport it to a crushing facility.

Mountaintop removal mining. Simply put, this method is the activity of removing the top of a mountain or a hill to access the minerals deposited beneath it. The overburden then is used to fill the nearby valleys. One could argue about the overlap between open-pit mining and mountaintop removal mining methods. For example, consider open-pit

## Oil sands surface mining - Energy Education
Surface mining is a technique used to obtain bitumen from oil sands where the oil sands deposits are located fairly close to the surface. If the reserves are shallow enough, earth moving equipment can dig out oil sand for processing. These deposits must be within 75 meters of the surface to be mined in this fashion. Resources recoverable by this type of extraction are estimated to be 65
