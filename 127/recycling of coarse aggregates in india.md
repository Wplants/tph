## Recycling of Concrete (Recycling Coarse Aggregate) - IJERT
Recycling of concrete is a simple process. It involves breaking, removing, and crushing existing concrete into a material with a specified size and quality. As per study about 75 to 80% of total construction material consist coarse aggregate portion. When the structure is demolished, the waste concrete in a large quantity is produced.

Said Kenai, in Waste and Supplementary Cementitious Materials in Concrete, 2018. Abstract. Construction industry generates huge amounts of debris that needs to be recycled and reused as recycled aggregates (RAs) for partial or total substitution of natural aggregates. Recycling reduces waste and reduces energy consumption and hence contributes to a more sustainable construction industry.
