Columbite. Columbite is a black mineral group that is an ore of niobium. It has a submetallic luster and a high density and is a niobate of iron and manganese. It forms a series with the tantalum-dominant analogue ferrotantalite and one with the manganese-dominant analogue manganocolumbite. Niobium is used in alloys for improved strength.

## RENEWED INTEREST FOR SOLID MINERALS IN NIGERIA - AfroEden

The vastness of Nigeria's minerals resources cannot and should not be over emphasised. We began to explore and exploit her natural mineral resources in 1902 and in its prime, the solid minerals sector was one of the largest producers of tin and coal, as well as a producer of a considerable 1.4 tons of gold annually.
