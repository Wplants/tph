Coal-mining employment increased rapidly in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and peaked in 1923 at 798,000. Since then, the number of miners has fallen considerably since, due to mechanization. By 2019 it had fallen below 55,000. Accidents Coal mining fatalities in the United States (data from US Dept. of Labor).

Abandoned Mine Education. In September of 2007, an all night search ended tragically Sunday morning near Chloride, a small town in northwest Arizona, after two girls, one 13-year-old and one 10-year-old, fell into an abandoned mine shaft. The girls were riding an ATV early Saturday evening when they plunged into the 125-foot-deep mine shaft.

Revenue for the "other mining" segments increased by 7%. Production. Production fell by 8% year-on-year at South Africa's mines, with a 44% decrease in output recorded in April as a result of the pandemic. The analysis notes that the most significant drop was due to reductions in gold, diamonds and PGM outputs.

## Coal Mining in Africa - SG
Jun 4, 2021Coal mining in Africa is still a profitable industry. While many countries move away from fossil fuels, mining production in Africa continues to rise. Much of the continent's coal comes from South Africa, which accounts for roughly 85% of production. In this article, we'll look at some of the main coal mines in Africa and how this industry affects the continent's economy.
