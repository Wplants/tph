① Dry. Rotary drying kiln is adopted to mainly remove some free water and crystal water from ores. ② Roasting - prereduction. Preheat the ore and selectively reduce some nickel and iron. ③ Electric furnace smelting. Reducing metal nickel and part of iron, separating slag and nickel iron to produce crude nickel iron. ④ Refining.

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Preparation of ferronickel from nickel laterite via coal-based 
The sticking phenomenon between molten slag and refractory is one of the crucial problems when preparing ferronickel from laterite ore using rotary hearth furnace or rotary kiln processes. This study aims to ameliorate sticking problems by using silicon dioxide (SiO2) to adjust the melting degree of the briquette during reduction roasting. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the melting

## Direct reduction of garnierite ore for production of ferro-nickel with 
Since the start of this ferro-nickel production, various improvements have been made. The characteristics of this process include: 1. (1) Economical aspect. Crude ferro-nickel can be produced at a low energy cost, using a rotary kiln after pretreatment of the raw materials. 2. (2) Availability of the product.
