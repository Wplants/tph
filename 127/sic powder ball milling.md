## Study of Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Ball milled Nano 
Apr 23, 2021FESEM Analysis Ball Milled Powder. The morphology of SiC particles after 40-h of milling time, as observed under FESEM is shown in Fig. 2.The particles are greatly fractured and larger fraction of nano size particles in 40-h milled samples are observed, this could be due to excess work hardening and enhancement of brittleness of the particles by milling [21, 22].

## Srilanka Sic Powder Ball Milling
Ball milling method for synthesis of nanomaterials. these silicon carbide balls provide very large amount of energy to the material powder and the powder then get crushed. this process of ball milling is done approximately 100 to 150 hrs to get uniform fine powder. 4. ball milling is a mechanical process and thus all the structural and.
