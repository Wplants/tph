Treatment of water from an open-pit copper mine . Open pit mining occurred there from 1953 until 1982, creating the most dramatic remnant of this mining activity, the Berkeley Pit. During its excavation, over 300 million m3 of rock were removed and the pit reached a depth of 542 m, making it one of the largest mine pits in the United States.

## Report on anthracite open pit mining: a feasibility study. Part I 
In the Mahanoy Creek Watershed study, the estimated reduction in acid mine drainage was under 50 percent. It appears possible that open pit mining of those areas previously devastated by mining, which still have large reserves of coal, followed by good reclamation by a mining company, could alleviate many environmental problems of these areas.
