## Forming of Quartz Crystals & Its Varietes Explained by PRO
Hot watery solutions, also known as hydrothermal environments, are a hotbed for quartz crystals in their purest forms. The hydrothermal process takes place at temperatures between 100°C and 450°C and requires high pressures to form the quartz crystals fully. [SinOm]-OH + H4SiO4 → [Sin+1Om+2]-OH + 2 H2O.

## Silica, Crystalline - Overview | Occupational Safety and Health 
Overview. Crystalline silica is a common mineral found in the earth's crust. Materials like sand, stone, concrete, and mortar contain crystalline silica. It is also used to make products such as glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, and artificial stone. Respirable crystalline silica - very small particles at least 100 times smaller than ordinary

## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.
