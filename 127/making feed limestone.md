## Limestone and Lime - Important Differences - Quirky Science
Limestone. Some may believe limestone is a rocky outcropping of lime, but such is not the case. Lime is not readily to be found in nature. Limestone is not the oxide of calcium, but the carbonate of calcium, CaCO 3. It is actually the salt theoretically produced through the reaction of calcium and carbonic acid, H 2 CO 3.

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
