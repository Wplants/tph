Barite is a major industrial mineral and the source of all barium and barium compounds. Some eight million metric tons of barite are recovered worldwide each year by open-pit mining of barite-rich sandstone. Because of barite's substantial density, crushed ore is easily concentrated by hydraulic, gravitational-separation methods.
