## Stating Some Negative Impacts Of Sand Mining On The Ecology!
Sand Mining Makes Areas Flood Prone: Sandbanks, dunes, and beaches act as a barrier from floods. But whenever extensive sand mining takes place, it removes these barriers. The areas near river bodies or seas become very prone to flooding. As a result, beachside communities become vulnerable to the forces of nature.

Destruction and poison linger. Bad mining practices can ignite coal fires, which can burn for decades, release fly ash and smoke laden with greenhouse gasses and toxic chemicals. Furthermore mining releases coal mine methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

The sands can be mined, and then processed, to remove the bitumen. Once processed, then bitumen can be then refined into oil. It is a complex process of extraction and separation that is often harvested through strip mining and underground heating. Most of the world's oil, an estimated 2 trillion barrels, is found in the bitumen of tar sands.
