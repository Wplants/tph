## Raw materials
Recycled steel (also called scrap steel) is one of the industry's most important raw materials. It comes from demolished structures and end of life vehicles and machinery as well as from the yield losses in the steelmaking process. Every steel plant is also a recycling plant, and all steel production uses scrap, up to 100% in the electric arc
