Physical processing: the physical process involves cleaning the surface of the quartz. In magnetic separation and high tension separation the minerals and quartz are separated depending on the surface charge. Chemical processing: floatation and acid leaching are the two primary processes in which the trace minerals from the quartz are removed.
