## CONCRETE MIX DESIGN USING CRUSHED SAND - The Constructor
Conclusion. The results of mix design indicate that crushed sand can also make as good a concrete as that made of natural sand.The compressive strength obtained is same as of normal mixes.In fact use of crushed sand will become inevitable in near future because of dwindling sources of natural sand.

## Crushed Sand vs. Natural Sand: Make the Right Choice!
The compressive strength as well as the flexural strength of concrete made from Crushed sand are higher than natural sand. Natural Sand.  It is recommended to use crushed sand. It is an economic and ecological alternative to natural sand. Crushed sand possesses properties similar to that of river and is a more sustainable construction material.
