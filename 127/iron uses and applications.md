Wrought iron is an alloy of iron having very low (less than 0.08%) amount of carbon in it. It contains some amount (up to 2%) of slag which gives it fibrous appearance. It can also contain a very small amount of Silicon, Sulfur and Phosphorous. It is very pure iron where the iron content can be up to 99.5%. It is produced by remelting pig iron.

## Iron - Element information, properties and uses | Periodic Table
Iron is an essential element for all forms of life and is non-toxic. The average human contains about 4 grams of iron. A lot of this is in haemoglobin, in the blood. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to the cells, where it is needed for tissue respiration. Humans need 10-18 milligrams of iron each day.

What is Cast Iron? Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2 to 4 percent. In addition, varying amounts of silicon from 1 to 3% by weight and manganese as well as traces of impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus. Cast iron is made by reducing Iron Ore in a Blast Furnace.
