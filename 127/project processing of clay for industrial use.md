## Project: Slurry Mixing and Dewatering Your Own Clay Body - Digitalfire
Slurry Mixing and Dewatering Your Own Clay Body. The process of propeller-mixing powder into a slurry and then dewatering that slurry on a plaster table is not practical on an industrial scale. But producing a workable plastic body in this way is certainly practical on a hobby or small business scale.

##  Evaluation of Industrial Potentials of Clay Deposits in Akwa  - IJSER
The industrial potential of clay minerals is a function of their physical and chemical properties but this project focuses on the physical properties of clay minerals that can quantify its usage for industrial ap-plication. The process by which clay is turn into products for industrial applications is extensive, requiring large capital in-
