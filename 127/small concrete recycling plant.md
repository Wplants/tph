## Recycling and Reusing Concrete - NY Engineers
Reusing concrete can help reduce construction costs, since it saves the cost of transporting concrete to the landfill, which is around $0.25/ton/mile. Recycling also eliminates disposal costs, while reducing the environmental impact of the project. Concrete that is recycled will not end up in landfills and can also replace raw materials.
