## Manufacturing process
Step 1: Mining. The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded

## New approach suggests path to emissions-free cement
Ordinary Portland cement, the most widely used standard variety, is made by grinding up limestone and then cooking it with sand and clay at high heat, which is produced by burning coal. The process produces carbon dioxide in two different ways: from the burning of the coal, and from gases released from the limestone during the heating.

The market for limestone is remarkably consistent. Quarried limestone can be used to neutralize acidity, so it can be added to soils or lakes. Limestone is used in the iron manufacturing industry, is required for cement, concrete, and mortar mixes, and is heated with sand and sodium carbonate to create glass. 3. It is extremely affordable.

According to some estimates, around 1.5 tons of limestone is required to produce a ton of cement. Cement manufacturing consumes minerals such as gypsum

## Limestone vs brick costssafe.shop
Limestone is a great building material that is strong and durable. It is cut into bricks and blocks. There are several differences between the two, including the size. Limestone bricks Bricks are the smaller of the two and are coursed so they can be used just like normal bricks . They have a 10mm joints, while blocks are cut to allow 20mm joins.

Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

Cement manufacturing process in summary. Portland cement is manufactured by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1,450 °C (2,640 °F) in a kiln, in a process known as calcination that liberates a molecule of carbon dioxide from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime.

After crushing, the crushed limestone is piled longitudinally by an equipment called stacker / reclaimer. The stacker deposits limestone longitudinally in the form of a pile. The pile is normally 250 to 300 m long and 8-10 m height. The reclaimer cuts the pile vertically, simultaneously from top to bottom to ensure homogenization of limestone.
