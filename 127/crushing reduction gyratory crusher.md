CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.

Crusher Machine Advantage. The good effect of fine crushing 1. There are cracks and other weak spots or defects in almost any particle. The double-cavity gyratory crushing, because of the multi-directional pressure on the material, under the interaction of multi-layer material, makes the material easier to be broken from the defect.
