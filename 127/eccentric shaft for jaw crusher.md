## Small Jaw Crushers
Small Jaw Crusher Capacity Table. Forced Feed Jaw Crushers. Small (Forced Feed Type) Jaw Crusher is ideal for small properties. A high ratio of reduction is obtained by the forced feed method of operation. The pitman moves on an eccentric shaft and rotates so that the material is constantly forced downward through the opening.
