Feb 9, 2022The process of gold mining. The process by which gold is mined and extracted involves four steps. First, gold ore is excavated from the soil, rock, and surrounding water tributaries either through direct excavation from the earth or through repurposing of old abandoned industrial gold mines and digging around mine shafts. 28 The gold ore is then processed and concentrated by gravity methods

However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.
