One of the most fundamental stages in open pit mining is drilling and blasting. A good fragmentation and a minimum ground vibration are characteristics of a successful drilling and blasting operation. In this study, 78 blasting events of AlvandQoly limestone mine located in Kurdestan cement company in west of Iran were investigated. The vibrations induced blasting was recorded by seismograph

## Blasting Method Of Limestone Quarrying
This method is employed for quarrying hard and compact stones. The various stages involved in the method of quarrying by blasting are as follows: Boring hole in the rock. The holes are usually made (of desired depth, from 1.25 to 2.5 m deep, and 20 to 40 mm diameter) with a steel bar with knife-edged ends called jumper.
