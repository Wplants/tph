## Blast furnace raw materialser-mueller-ehlers
The raw materials used in blast furnace smelting are mainly composed of iron ore, fuel (coke) and flux (limestone). Generally, smelting 1 ton of pig iron requires 1.5-2.0 tons of iron ore, 0.4-0.6 tons of coke, 0.2-0.4 tons of flux, a total of 2-3 tons of raw materials.In order to ensure the continuity of blast furnace production, it is.

World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron. The only source of primary iron is iron ore, but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel, it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace.

## Bloomery
The bloomery was the earliest form of smelter capable of smelting iron. Bloomeries produce a porous mass of iron and slag called a bloom. The mix of slag and iron in the bloom, termed sponge iron, is usually consolidated and further forged into wrought iron. Blast furnaces, which produce pig iron, have largely superseded bloomeries.

About 16 pounds of Bentonite are added to every ton of iron ore concentrate. Small amounts of limestone (1%) are also added and mixed with the concentrate at this point. Limestone is added to meet the requirements of steel customers in the blast furnace process. The iron ore concentrate is now mixed and ready for the pelletizing process.

## How Iron Was Made - Saugus Iron Works National  - National Park Service
Feb 16, 2022How Iron Was Made. Iron making evolved over a few thousand years. Using the ancient "bloomery" method, iron ore was converted directly into wrought iron by heating the ore while at the same time melting the ore's impurities and squeezing them out with hand hammers. This is also called the "direct process." By the 1100s water-powered hammers

## Iron Ore Pellets Market Size and Share | Statistics - 2027
This has impacted the pricing of iron ore in many parts of the world due to its declining consumption in the steel market. On the other hand, the steel industry is likely to grow steadily post 2021 due to the rebounding construction and automotive industries. Blast furnace grade of iron ore pellets will dominate the industry

## Blast Furnace Ironmaking - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The ironmaking blast furnace (BF) is a very energy-intensive metallurgical process and the prime route for steel production, from which about 70% of the world's steel consumption is produced ( Geerdes et al., 2015 ). The BF system receives coke and ore solid raw material along with hot blast air and continuously produces hot metal as the main
