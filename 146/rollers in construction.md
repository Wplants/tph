## The Use Of Rollers In Road Construction - Every Single Topic
The front roller is steered and the back rollers are driven. Currently, the diesel powered roller compactors are the main rollers used in the road construction. The operation of the roller compactors depends greatly on their weight, which determines the amount of the compaction force that is being applied to the ground surface.

Compactors, most commonly referred to as "rollers," are used to densify soils on larger sites. Rollers are heavy vehicles with a large metal drum roller, which compresses the soil as it is driven over the fill. Rollers are oftentimes equipped with mechanical vibrators, which improves the compaction performance of the roller.
