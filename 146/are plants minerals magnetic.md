## Types of magnetic materials and their properties with examples - Ox Science
There are Five types of magnetic materials. Examples of magnetic materials are: Paramagnetic materials. Diamagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials. Ferrimagnetism. Antiferromagnetism. Aluminum, manganese, etc are examples of paramagnetic materials, Copper, water, alcohol are some examples of diamagnetic materials.

## Magnetic Metals & Non-Magnetic Metals With Examples | Fractory
This property helps generate electricity in power plants. Conclusion. With a large enough magnetic field, all types of metals will interact with a magnet. This is because eddy currents are set up in metals when they are subjected to a moving magnetic field. Using this principle, metal detectors are able to detect non-magnetic metals like gold

## Magnetite
Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.

Mar 6, 2022Are you minerals attracted to magnet? Several minerals react when placed within a magnetic field. Some minerals are strongly attracted to the magnet others are weakly attracted and one mineral is actually repelled. . This property is exhibited in few minerals notably Magnetite and Pyrrhotite. Paramagnetism is weak attraction to magnetic fields.
