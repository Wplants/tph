## In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore?
Answer:In the extraction of copper from its Sulphide Ore, when ore is subjected to roasting some of it is oxidised to Cu2O which reacts with the remaining Cu2S to give copper metal. In this process, Cu2S behaves as reducing agent. Is used for the extraction of copper by the reduction of cuprous oxide? - Therefore, in the extraction of copper

The leaching process can result in the virtually complete extraction of copper at atmospheric pressure in as little as four hours. A method of leaching copper from copper sulphide-containing concentrates, such as chalcopyrite, includes using pyrite as a catalyst for ferric reduction in order to eliminate passivation of the chalcopyrite surface

Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials.

## Which sulphide ore is concentrated by leaching?
Which of the following are sulphide ores? Therefore copper pyrites is a sulphide ore.. Which of the sulphide ores Cannot be successfully concentrated by flotation process? Galena (PbS), sphalerite (Zn,Fe)S, chalococite (Cu2S) Althrough argentite (Ag2S) is a sulphide ore, it is not concentrated by froth flotation process since its silver content is low. It is better concentrated by leaching
