In some countries it is obligatory to ensure that a plant can operate on at least two types of fuel: major and backup. Traditionally, the most widespread fuel for steam power plants is coal due to its proximity, ease of production and lower cost, hence the coal-fired technology is one of the most established for steam power plants. 8.2.1 Coal

## Pulverized coal-fired boiler
A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.
