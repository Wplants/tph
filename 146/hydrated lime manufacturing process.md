## Hydrated Lime - Santosh Chemicals
Hydrated lime (or calcium hydroxide, or slaked lime) is usually a dry powder resulting from the controlled slaking of quicklime with water. The exothermic or released heat of reaction is captured and used to evaporate the excess slaking water. Chemical formula: Ca (OH)2. Chemical composition of Hydrated Lime available in each grade.
