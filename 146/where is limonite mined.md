## Limonite Gem Guide and Properties Chart | Gemstones
Limonite has been used as pigment since the Neolithic. It is still used today for yellow and brown pigments. There is evidence that Limonite has been mined for iron production since 2500 BCE and it used to be called "bog iron". It is considered too impure for modern iron commercial mining.

## Limonite: an iron oxide used as pigment and iron ore - Geology
Limonite has been used as a low-quality iron ore for thousands of years. Commercial mining of limonite as a source of iron is no longer done in areas where reasonable deposits of hematite and magnetite are present or readily imported. Limonite deposits are usually too small and too impure for use in modern metallurgy.

Score: 4.2/5 (47 votes) . It is usually formed from the chemical weathering of iron rich minerals, such as biotite, amphibole, pyroxene, and olivine, the hydration/oxidation of iron rich sulfide minerals, or from the hydration of magnetite and hematite.Limonite is commonly deposited in run-off streams resulting from mining operations.

## Limonite
Limonite (/ Ëˆ l aÉª m É™ ËŒ n aÉª t /) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)Â· n H 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite
