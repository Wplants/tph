## Pressing (wine)
In winemaking, pressing is the process where juice is extracted from the grapes with the aid of a wine-press, by hand, or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters. Historically, intact grape clusters were trodden by feet but in most wineries today the grapes are sent through a crusher/destemmer, which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins

Cold-pressing type sesame oil extraction machines administer the precise amount of force to crush the seeds and apply a good amount of friction to heat the seeds naturally. The machine's expeller mechanism then keeps the oil at temperatures not higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit which is why oils produced this way are called cold-pressed.
