## Project Report on GRANITE MINING - Manufacturing Process - Books 
If a granite contains very large crystals of feldspar (0.5 - 3.1 cm long), set in an even grained matrix, it is described as porphyritic, and the very large crystals are called phenocrysts. The crystals in granite are large because granite crystallized slowly from molten rock (magma), over 2 km below the Earth's surface.

Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes. The leakage of chemicals from mining sites can also have detrimental effects on the health of the population living at or around the mining site.

Mine water Mine water or mining influenced water (not: mine wastewater, mining impacted water, mining affected water) is all the water in a surface or underground mine or seeping through waste rock. Strictly speaking, the water from the processing plant and the tailings is process water, as it contains human-induced process chemicals.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.
