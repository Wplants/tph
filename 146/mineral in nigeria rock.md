Common Rock-forming Minerals Although there are around 5000 different mineral species, only a few form rocks and are called "rock-forming minerals". Most minerals are "accessory minerals" that occur in small quantities within a rock. The common rock-forming minerals are plagioclase feldspars, alkali feldspar, quartz, amphiboles, micas, olivine, pyroxenes, calcite and dolomite.
