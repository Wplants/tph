##  Introduction to the Geodiversity of Perth: A Self-Guided Tour of Rocks 
A series of successful limestone and sandstone quarries operated near Perth. The Hughes Quarry, for example, was worked in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and supplied stone for new buildings. Nearby clay deposits provided materials for mortar. The Hughes Quarry was known for supplying a dressed stone with distinctive purple

## Spontaneous succession in limestone quarries as an effective 
Limestone quarries are thought to be particularly important for restoration, because the base-rich bedrock allows the development of species-rich natural communities, such as calcareous grasslands, which are among the richest and most continentally endangered habitats in Europe (e.g. Jefferson 1984; Poschlod & Wallis DeVries 2002).

## Limestone Quarry Restoration - Evaluation plan of restoration methods 
Alvars are globally rare habitats with rich and distinctive vegetation-communities. Alvars are found on limestone bedrock which is also subject to quarrying for cement production. The increasing global need for cement results in either expanding existing quarries or the opening of new ones. Current legislation requires the restoration of limestone quarries after they are closed for quarrying

Important Things To Know With Limestone Restoration. We import lime mortars from Europe as this is a proven method of restoring limestone and old bricks and is the standard throughout Europe. Even if your limestone has decayed significantly we can rebuild the faces of the stone without damaging the structure underneath unlike cement-based products that accelerate erosion 100% of the time.
