## Fiber-Reinforced Concrete | Advantages & Disadvantages | UQ
The right fiber-reinforced concrete can also provide impact resistance, increase tensile strength and reduce voids in the concrete. Here are the main advantages of fiber reinforced concrete: Prevents maximum corrosion in civil structures. Minimizes the cavitation damage in structures - navigational locks, bridges, piers, sluice-ways.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregates - Properties and Uses of Recycled 
3. Density. The density of crushed concrete aggregate is smaller than natural aggregate density. 4. Water Absorption. Water absorption of recycled aggregate is greater than of natural aggregate. It is one of the most significant properties that distinguish recycled aggregate from raw aggregates.

Concrete crushing after yielding of steel reinforcement represents an under-reinforced member, which is typical of current reinforced concrete design standards. This failure mode ensures that a high level of member ductility is maintained prior to failure, thus providing ample warning before collapse. In the case of FRP-strengthened members

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
It's recycling! Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.

Nov 22, 2021This is steel wire welded together in a square grid pattern to form a flat sheet. The steel wire thickness is usually 4 mm. And the typical grid size is 150 mm x 150 mm. Both types of steel reinforcement are used in masonry projects. Typically, rebar goes around the footing while the welded mesh goes into the slab, often creating a cage.
