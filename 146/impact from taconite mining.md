## Commercialization of Taconite | MNopedia
Though taconite was identified as an iron-bearing rock on the Iron Ranges of northern Minnesota long before the 1950s, it wasn't until then that it was extracted, processed, and shipped to steel mills on the Great Lakes. As natural ore reserves diminished, taconite became an alternative source of iron that allowed the Iron Range to continue mining operations in a changing global economy.

## Taconite | EROS - USGS
Taconite is a hard, dense rock containing a mixture of silicates and magnetite and is abundant on the Mesabi Range. New processing methods developed in the mid-20th century made taconite mining profitable. After it's mined, the taconite is crushed into a fine powder. The magnetite is separated with magnets and agglomerated into marble-sized

## Why is taconite significant? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022What is taconite and why is it used instead of just magnetite or hematite to get iron? Because of their low iron grade, taconite and magnetite require greater processing than hematite in order to form an iron concentrate product of 60-70%. The beneficiation process for taconite requires crushing, screening, grinding, magnetic separation, filtering and finally drying.

May 24, 2022Stauber noted mining has been a dominant industry in Northern Minnesota for more than a century. "It's about ending an industry that has employed Minnesotans and Iron Rangers for over 130 years," he said. McCollum noted there was a carve out in the bill for taconite mining, a traditional Iron Range product.

But as the supply of high-grade natural ore decreased, industry began to view taconite as a resource.  Taconite saved Minnesota's iron ore mining industry.  The toxicity of this material is due to chemical and biological effects of high pH, alkalinity, electrical conductivity (EC), and Na(+) and Al(3+) concentrations.

The current taconite mining industry in Minnesota produces about 36Mt./a of taconite and employs about 4,000 employees. At the peak of the operation in the 1980s, eight taconite mines were in operation on the Mesabi range. Mined land reclamation rules adopted in Minnesota in 1980 require that all mined land be left in a stable and safe condition.

In 1947 Pickands Mather announced that Erie would build a demonstration plant to make taconite ore into pellets — three tons of taconite to make one ton of pellets and two tons of tailings. And the plant would be massive. Erie opened in 1957. The total cost seemed astronomical — $300 million — and it would take four years.

The majority of historical iron mining activities in Wisconsin involved the removal of high-grade (direct-shipping) ore, which was mined in several areas throughout the state. The major remaining deposits are taconite, a low-grade (typically 20-30% iron) ore that requires processing to increase the iron content and remove impurities.
