## Holy coal! The problems that India's coal industry faces | Qrius
Earlier, in 2014 the Supreme Court of India cancelled 204 coal mines earmarked for governments and private companies, albeit for captive use only, since 1993, declaring it "illegal and arbitrary". Following the Apex Court's findings, the decision was aimed at creating increased accountability and transparency in the allocation of coal blocks.

Coal usage in India also has impacts beyond India. In 2011, though India's annual per-capita CO2 emissions in 2011 at 1.6 tons was considerably lower than the global average of 4.9 tons, India was the world's third largest emitter of CO2 with 1,970 million tons. Of this, coal usage contributed about 970 million tons, or about 3% of world

India produces 89 minerals by operating 569 coal mines, 67 oil and gas mines, 1,770 non-coal mines, and several more small mines, running into over a lakh, all of which translate into direct employment of about 1 million on a daily average basis and an overall sector contribution of about 5 per cent to the country's gross domestic product.

## Why is there a coal crisis in India? - INSIGHTSIAS
Apr 18, 2022This is worrisome because coal-fired plants make up nearly 70% of India's power source mix. It is expected that the peak demand may increase up to 210 GW in April'2022. Therefore, all the coal-based power plants need to have adequate coal stocks, enabling supply of coal-based power to the extent of about 160 GW during peak hours.

## Coal crisis in India: Reasons, Importance, solution - Analysis
Oct 14, 2021India is facing an acute coal shortage, major thermal plants across the country are at the critically low-level supply of coal. Most of the power stations had only 3-5 days of coal, this is lower than the prescribed guidelines of supplies of 2 weeks minimum.; As the economy recovered from the pandemic crisis, there was a sharp rise in the demand for coal as the power demand increased.

## Distribution of Coal in India: Gondwana Coalfields & Tertiary  - PMF IAS
Problems of Coal Mining in India. The distribution of coal is uneven. High ash content and low caloric value. Large percentage of coal is taken out from underground mines. [Very few open cast mines] Heavy losses due to fires in the mines. Pilferage at several stages also adds to losses - bad transportation infrastructure.

## Opencast Coal Mining at Large Depth in India-challenges Ahead
In India, around 92% of the coal is produced by opencast mining method (Table 1). If do mestic coa l pro duction cont inues at 5% increasing rate, the extractable r eserve will last for 45 years.

## Fugitive Methane Emissions from Indian Coal Mining and Handling 
Fugitive methane emissions from fossil fuel extraction account for significant contribution towards greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in India. Out of total all-India GHG emissions of 1.88 million Gg-CO 2 equivalent in 2010 (with LULUCF), 48928.66 Gg-CO 2 equivalent belonged to fugitive emissions from fossil fuel extraction. Methane emission from coal mining and handling activities has increased
