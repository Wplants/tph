Small-scale mining by the artisanal and small-scale mining sector (ASM) has expanded rapidly in Ghana. More than 60% of the total mining labor force is in this sector. The ASM in 2014 produced about 34% of exported gold (compared to 9% in 2000) making it a major sector of the Ghanaian economy and an important source of livelihood and income for

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

The history of small-scale mining in Zimbabwe dates back to the period well before colonization in the late 1890s. As late as 1908, over 70% of the country`s mines were still classified as small workings (G. Mukwada; 2000). As in other countries, gold mining was the basis for the wealth and power of many empires

Aug 19, 2021People living and working in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) areas are frequently exposed to elemental mercury (Hg), which is used for gold extraction. However, additional exposure to other toxic metals such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) may result from mining-related activities and could be ingested via dust, water or food. In these areas, only limited biomonitoring

Central to the growth of gold production is Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM). The ASM sector eclipsed gold output from large-scale miners in 2017 and 2018, a trend which is likely to continue judging by last year's results. Latest gold delivery data from Fidelity Printers and Refiners (FPR) show that, in 2019, ASM accounted for 63

Small scale mining is permitted in Zimbabwe unlike in other countries. The CEO of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation at a meeting held in Kadoma in 2013 cited that Zimbabwe has been taking part in artisanal mining since the era of Munhumutapa Empire in 15 th century. This involved the trading of gold between Shona people and Portuguese people.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a thorny issue for both governments and large scale mining (LSM) companies.  In Zimbabwe, for example, artisanal diamond miners in the Marange area increased from a handful in 2004 to an estimated 35 000 in 2007. In Ghana ASM contributed 9% of total gold production in 2000, but by 2010 this had risen
