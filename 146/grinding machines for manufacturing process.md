## Grinding & Milling: 2 Most Basic Machining Processes
Grinding wheels are also manufactured from a solid steel or aluminum disc with particles bonded to the surface. To keep grinding machines working optimally, the use of fluids during the grinding process is necessary to cool and lubricate the wheel and workpiece. Lubrication also helps to remove the chips produced in the grinding process.
