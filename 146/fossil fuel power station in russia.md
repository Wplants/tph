## Fossil-fuel power station Wiki
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity. Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator. The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating gas engine.

In a process to convert fossil fuel into work, fossil fuel is burned to directly surrender heat energy to a process. In this process the fossil fuel is burned with oxygen in the presence of carbon monoxide returned from the combustion output to produce a gas mixture of between 800 and 1500 deg C which drives a gas turbine.
