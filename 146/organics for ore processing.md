## Sourcing organic ingredients for processing - Oregon Tilth
Before purchasing ingredients for your product, you must confirm the organic certificate for each product or ingredient is valid and in good standing. Transaction certificates cannot take the place of a valid organic certificate. We recommend starting the verification process of organic certificates by using the USDA Organic Integrity Database.

Zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium.The word is related to Persian zargun (zircon; zar-gun, "gold-like" or "as gold"). It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium.

While calcining is an option, it's costly to build, energy intensive, and includes emissions. This invention is a process for removing organics from sedimentary phosphate ores.

## vanadium processing | Britannica
vanadium processing, preparation of the metal for use in various products. Vanadium (V) is a grayish silver metal whose crystal structure is a body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice, with a melting point of 1,926° C (3,499° F). The metal is used principally as an alloying addition to high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels and, to a lesser extent, in tool steels and iron and steel castings.
