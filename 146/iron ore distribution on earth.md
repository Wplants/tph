## The Distribution of Iron in Nature | SpringerLink
Abstract. Iron, in the form of various combined ores, is one of the most common elements, constituting about 5% of the earth's crust. The most important iron-containing minerals are the oxides and sulfides. Hematite (red iron ore, Fe 2 O 3 ), magnetite (loadstone, Fe 3 O 4 ), and goethite (hydrous iron oxide, FeO 2 H) belong to the former

These ores are found in the oldest known rocks in the crust of the earth, with an age in excess of 2.5 billion years, as well as in rocks formed in various subsequent ages.  Exploration is the process by which the accumulations of iron ore

## Production and Distribution of Iron Ore around the World
Till 1975, its production of iron ore in the world was only 6.5 per cent, but in year 2000, China produced 24.3 per cent iron ore of the world. This percentage further increased to 30.77 in year, accordingly China is now first in iron ore production in the world. Its annual production of iron ore is about 520 million tons.

## ore distribution in world
Iron Ore Distribution: World and India. The iron ore is found in following four types: Magnetite: It is the most important and best kind of iron ore. It contains about 72 percent metallic iron in it. It is black in colour. Hematite: It is also an important source. It contains about 60-70 percent metallic iron in it. It is red and brown in colour.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

Jan 20, 2022How Is Metal Produced From Ore? Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore. . Charcoal burned with hematite ore for instance smelts iron. Electrolysis separates metal from ore by using acid and electricity. May 7 2011
