## High Performance Concrete Topic
High-performance concrete (HPC) is concrete that has been designed to be more durable and, if necessary, stronger than conventional concrete. HPC mixtures are composed of essentially the same materials as conventional concrete mixtures, but the proportions are designed, or engineered, to provide the strength and durability needed for the structural and environmental requirements of the project.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
