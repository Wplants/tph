Voltage. V. Frequency. 50-60 Hz. n a coal based thermal power plant, the initial process in the power generation is "Coal Handling". So in this article i will discuss the overall processes carried out at a Coal Handling plant in a coal based thermal power generating station. The huge amount of coal is usually supplied through railways.

Dry Fog Dust Separation ( DFDS) System. They are used to control the fine dust particle Produced during the coal flow. DFDS system uses high pressure of air (about 3-4 bar) and low pressure of water (about 2-3bar),which generates dry fog and being sprayed at the point of dust generation .The spray angle covers 30 to 90 degree.

The plant will run on diesel until it is able to generate its own electricity from coal. The deals end a year-long dispute between the government and Dangote Cement after the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) failed to provide electricity. The plant plans to import coal from South Africa, which is a cheaper option than buying it locally.

Coal preparation plants that employ fine coal cleaning by froth flotation can produce an unacceptable amount of moisture in the product. Thermal drying, in which the wet coal is dried in the hot gas generated by a coal-or gas-fired burner, is used in some plants to reduce the moisture content. Refuse and tailings management.

Costs of producing SNG via gasifying coal were estimated by the 2007 interdisciplinary MIT study to be from 6.7 to 7.5 dollars per million Btus. 1. Process Efficiency. Table 1 lists some of the published plant performance and efficiencies of the various coal-to-SNG design configurations. The data contained in this table is taken from references

## Coal gasification
Coal gasification is the process of producing syngas—a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and water vapour (H 2 O)—from coal and water, air and/or oxygen.. Historically, coal was gasified to produce coal gas, also known as "town gas".Coal gas is combustible and was used for heating and municipal lighting, before the
