## Modeling and optimization of Carbon in leach (CIL) circuit for gold 
The CIL process concentrates gold from 2.5-3.5 g/t in ore to 2000 to 6000 g/t on carbon. Although the earliest process was in South Africa in 1890, CIP/CIL was first introduced in gold processing in 1949 at San Andreas (Honduras) (Marsden and House, 2006). As the ore grades have deteriorated from around 12 grams per tonne in 1950 to nearly 3
