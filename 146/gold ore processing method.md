## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

Alkaline cyanide solutions are used to extract gold from ores. Because the ores are finely ground (unlike heap-leaching), large quantities of fine tailings are produced and require storage in tailings dams. The tailings will be acidic in the case of copper processing and alkaline in the case of gold processing. 13.

## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

## Roasting and Refractory Gold Ore - Manhattan Gold & Silver
During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process
