## A List of European Natural Resources - The Classroom
Europe has many natural resources, from oil and natural gas to gold and uranium. In places like Russia, the difficulty of the terrain has been a roadblock in unleashing its tremendous power in gold, natural gas and oil, while tiny Kosovo has become a target largely because of her disproportionately large endowments in strategic minerals.
