## Quarry fines: an ideal material for the manufacture of foamed concrete 
Oct 8, 2020Thus, quarry dust or quarry fines refer to undersized material or a residue/tailing material subsequent to the mining and dispensation of rocks to develop tiny aggregates, whose sizes are below 4.75 mm. This residue is usually less than 0.075 mm in size. Its properties will vary with rock type.

## Aggregates for Concrete - GreenSpec
Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

The fine aggregates result in; Provide dimensional stability to the mixture. With it, the elastic modulus and abrasion resistance of concrete can be influenced. The quality of aggregates also influence the hardening properties and mixture proportions. On the shrinkage of concrete, the fine aggregate properties also have a significant impact.
