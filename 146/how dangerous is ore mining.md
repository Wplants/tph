May 20, 2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Because lead can be absorbed through dermal and mouth contact, this form of exposure can be particularly dangerous for children. Miners are also at risk of exposure if they do not have protective equipment and frequently come into direct contact with ore containing lead. Miners can also inhale lead as dust during the mining and crushing processes.
