This process characterized by easier operation, longer flotation time, fewer concentrate flotation and process concentrate ore from different stages of separation, which can recovery nickel ore as soon as possible in the flotation process. The solution of copper-sulfide nickel ore get nickel grade of 12% of high profit.
