## What do you call a vacuum that sucks up water? - Quora
Answer (1 of 3): When I did carpet shampooing or picking up water from a flooded basement we called the machine an extractor. A commercial vacuum that looks like a shop vac but is more durable (and quieter) is called a canister vac. The canister vac can be quickly converted to wet or dry vacuumin

## Sucking water with shop vac???? Community Forums
I looked at the manual for a craftsman shop vac that is about 6 yrs old and it says if you suck alot of water to take off the filter. I looked at new shop vacs and they say leave the filter on and either use a water filter or use a special slever over the filter. Upvote. # 4., 06:35 PM.
