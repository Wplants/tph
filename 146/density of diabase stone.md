## What is the density of stone? - Quora
Answer (1 of 10): Depends on what your stone is: Rock Types and Specific Gravity 1.Granite: 2.6-2.7 gm/cc 2.Dolerite: 3.0-3.5 gm/cc 3. Sandstone: 2.2-2.8 gm/cc 4.Shale: 2.0-2.4 gm/cc 5.Limestone: 2.2-2.6 gm/cc I think that ought to be enough. tl;dr around 2.2-3.0 gm/cc is a good average.

One site gave the value of 2.5lb density rock wool as R-3.7 per inch thickness and R-3.9 per inch for 4lb density. If we extrapolate, then the 8lb density would have even higher R value, though not twice that of 4lb.

## Basalt/Diabase Stone Crusher - Fote Machinery(FTM)
What is the Difference Between Diabase and Basalts? Diabase stone is often a rock bed, a rock wall, a rock vein, also as a rock neck or a rock strain, filled in basalt crater. The above occurrence of diabase is the main sign that it is different from gabbro and basalt stone. Diabase is smaller in size and more suitable for fine aggregate

## Bulk density of crushed stone/bsn
The bulk density of crushed stone is measured by the average or actual amount of material per unit of measurement. Moreover, for one type of stone this indicator may differ due to the size of the fragments: the smaller they are, the higher the value.

## Tru-Stone frequently asked questions: The world's largest manufacturer 
A) Diabase is a variety of a stone type known as Gabbro. While it is closely related to granite, it is not the same. Diabase lacks several of the minerals (such as quartz and mica) which give granite its distinctive grain structure. The lack of quartz means that diabase is slightly less resistant to wear than the hardest granites.

## Gabbro-diabase: properties of a stone for a bath, subtleties of 
Gabbro-diabase is a rocky rock formed on the site of extinct volcanoes. Geological scientists argue that it is scientifically incorrect to call this rock gabbro-diabase. The fact is that the group of diabases includes several rocks at once, differing in origin, occurring at different depths and, as a consequence, having different structures and

The density is expressed as a number which indicates how much heavier the gemstone is compared to an equal volume of water. Most gemstone varieties are 2 to 4 times denser than a equal volume of water. But the range is quite wide -- from 8 for cinnabar to 1 for amber. Diamond, at 3.50 to 3.53, falls approximately in the middle.
