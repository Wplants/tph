Surface Mining. Surface-mining methods include area, contour, mountaintop removal, and auger. Area mines are surface mines that remove shallow coal over a broad area of fairly flat land. Huge dragline shovels remove rocks overlying the coal (called overburden). After the coal has been removed, the rock is placed back into the pit.

One of the ways of Extracting Coal from the ground is called strip mining. This technique comes under surface mining and is used when the coal is found very near the top of the land. To get to the coal one has to remove the top layer of rock and soil. The exact steps that are carried out in strip mining are detailed below. 1.

## Mining Methods - Indian Infrastructure
The demand for high quality coal can be met by adopting underground production methods such as cut-and-fill, bord-and-pillar, shrinkage stopping and longwall coal mining. These methods are supported by highly mechanised equipment. Key among these are continuous miners, longwall mining, load haul dumper and sub-level stoping. Continuous miners

## Coal Mining -The 2 Most Basic Techniques Of Extraction
They are two most basic methods that miners use to quarry coal. While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below, underground mining is used for coal that is located lower. In surface mining, the top layer is removed which may include plants, soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.

Feb 15, 2022Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Mountaintop removal mining
Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or overburden, above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.

Conventional mining is the oldest method. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining. In continuous mining, a machine known as a continuous miner cuts the coal from the mining face, obviating the need for drilling and blasting.
