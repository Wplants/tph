## Basalt and Granite
Basalt and granite actually have quite a bit in common. Both are igneous rocks, which means that they cooled from a magma (the earth gets very hot just below the surface, and there is lots of liquid rock available). Both are made up of minerals from the silicate group, so both have large amounts of silicon and oxygen.

However, there are some important differences between these two types of rock. For one, diorite is usually darker in color than granite, with a gray or bluish-gray hue. It also has a more fine-grained texture than granite, which tends to be coarser. Diorite is typically made up of feldspar, quartz, and other minerals like hornblende or biotite.

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ɪ t / (UK) or / ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t / (US) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.

basalt, extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock that is low in silica content, dark in colour, and comparatively rich in iron and magnesium. Some basalts are quite glassy (tachylytes), and many are very fine-grained and compact. It is more usual, however, for them to exhibit porphyritic structure, with larger crystals (phenocrysts) of olivine, augite, or feldspar in a finely crystalline matrix

Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. By definition, basalt is an aphanitic (fine-grained) igneous rock with generally 45-55% silica (SiO 2 ) and less than 10% feldspathoid by volume, and where at least 65% of the rock is feldspar in the form of plagioclase.

Basalts having grains, though very small rather minute, are called aphanitic basalts. Chemically basalts contain 45 to 65 per cent of silica content. Though the rock is heavy in weight but is more susceptible to chemical weathering and fluvial erosion. The dark colour of basalts is because of the abundance of iron.

## Which is more dense granite or basalt? - Answers
Granite is very much less dense than basalt. This is why the continental crust (mostly composed of granite) floats on Oceanic crust (made mostly of basalt). Granite is 70 % silicon. Where basalt

## Physical Geology Lab Samples - Georgia Southwestern State University
BASALT Basalt is an extrusive mafic volcanic rock. It is commonly erupted as passive lava flows due to its low viscosity (resulting from high magmatic temperatures and low silica contents). A dominant component of oceanic crust, basalt is the most abundant volcanic rock. Texture: aphanitic. Composition: mafic (enriched in iron and magnesium)

##  Density of Earth Materials Lab - Mercer Island School District
its average composition is similar to the rock granite. Granite is a felsic rock (which means it has a high feldspar and silica content), composed of quartz, potassium-rich feldspar, and mica. Mafic rocks contain denser minerals and therefore, oceanic crust is denser than continental crust (the average density of basalt is 3.0 g/cm3 3and
