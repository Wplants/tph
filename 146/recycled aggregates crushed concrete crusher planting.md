## Recycled Concrete Aggregates: A Review | International Journal of 
After demolition of old roads and buildings, the removed concrete is often considered worthless and disposed of as demolition waste. By collecting the used concrete and breaking it up, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is created (Fig. 1).This paper focuses on coarse RCA which is the coarse aggregate from the original concrete that is created after the mortar is separated from the rock which

## Everything You Need To Know About Recycled Crushed Concrete
Sep 14, 2020Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

However, using a recycled aggregate of more than 65% can impact the mix's durability significantly, reducing its physical properties tenfold. The optimum amount blended in with the concrete should be 35%. Some experiments have shown that the recycled aggregate is durable, no doubt, but not as sturdy as natural coarse aggregate.
