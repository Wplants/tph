## Lead - Essential Chemical Industry
The process is carried out in a series of tanks. As the lead and zinc minerals are less readily wetted than the gangue, they adhere to the air bubbles which are carried to the surface. The rock particles sink and the lead and zinc ores are skimmed off. Then the lead ore is separated from the zinc ore.

Rarely is the ore, as mined, rich enough to be used directly by smelters; it needs to be concentrated. Zinc ores contain 5-15% zinc. To concentrate the ore it is first crushed and then ground to enable optimal separation from the other minerals. Typically, a zinc concentrate contains about 55% of zinc with some copper, lead and iron.

## Provenance Tracing and Age Analysis of Lead-Zinc Mineralization in 
Sep 10, 2022No lead-zinc ore body has been found in the intrusive body of the mining area. The mining area includes NW striking and 60-70° SW dipping faults. These faults comprise the ore bearing structure of the lead-zinc orebodies.  In the process of upward migration, the ore-forming material was contaminated by crust derived material. 6.2

## Lead Zinc Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
1 Lead-zinc sulfide ore 1. Beneficiation process of lead-zinc sulfide ore: The main constituent minerals of lead sulphide ore are galena and sphalerite, all of which are primary ore. Galena has good floatability. In most lead-zinc mines, zinc is higher than lead. Most of the lead-zinc sulfide mine uses preferential flotation technology
