Ironsand, also known as iron-sand or iron sand, is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe 3 O 4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium.. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.

Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is
