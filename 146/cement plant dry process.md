Summary of production process. Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of

The spray dry process generally has lower capital costs but higher and more expensive sorbent use (typically lime) than wet processes. This process is used primarily for small- to medium-sized plants firing low- to medium-sulfur coals and is preferable for retrofits [16].For example, Blythe et al.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Modern, dry-process cement plants with efficient configuration of grinding and pyro processing systems typically consume less than 700 kcal/kg-cl thermal energy and 100 kWh/mt of electrical energy. Older plants have inefficient systems, which compounded with operational and maintenance inadequacies, tend to have much higher energy consumption.

The flow process for batching plants begin when the aggregates are fed into separate bins. These aggregates are weighed separately as required by the control panel's design set. After they are weighed, they are moved to the mixing area. Above this are weigh hoppers for the water, additives, and cement.
