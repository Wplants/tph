An Introduction. One of the most common forms of green healing clay is Bentonite, an Aluminum Silicate smectite. It often contains substantial amounts of magnesium and a wide variety of trace minerals. Through its natural evolution, bentonite ( as well as montmorrilonite ) also selectively adsorbs an interesting variety of organic material.

This shows that there must be other motives to compound polymers with fillers. These follow. Fillers can be used either to increase or to decrease the density of a product. Because the density of a filler can be as high as 10 g/cm3 or as low as 0.03 g/cm3, there may be a large difference between the density of the filler and the polymer.
