## Waste Materials Used in Concrete Manufacturing (Building Materials 
The output of waste materials suitable as cement replacement (slags, fly ashes, silica fumes, rice husk ash, etc.) is more than double that of cement production. These waste materials can partly be used, or processed, to produce materials suitable as aggregates or fillers in concrete.

Waste Materials Used in Concrete Manufacturing. The environmental aspects involved in the production and use of cement, concrete and other building materials are of growing importance. CO2 emissions are 0.8-1.3 ton/ton of cement production in dry process. SO2 emission is also very high, but is dependent upon the type of fuel used.

## What to do with "concrete waste" at any type of concrete plant.
Your best solution for excess concrete materials at any concrete plant starts with simply addressing the issue, and developing a plan. Without a plan, your pile of "concrete waste" will likely continue to grow. With a well thought-out plan, you'll find operational, compliance, and financial benefits you likely aren't receiving now.

This article focuses on the compression strength of lightweight concrete based on alkaline-activated waste materials. The problem is important not only because of the possibility of disposal of excessive amount of building or industrial waste, but also because of the decreasing amount of natural aggregate deposits.

## Construction Wastes: Types, Causes, and Recycling Strategies
Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.
