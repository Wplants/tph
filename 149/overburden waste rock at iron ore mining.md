## Waste Mine Tailings Characterisation
This is especially true of the copper, iron, and uranium industries. A total of 31,191 million tons of overburden, waste rock, and tailings was generated by the metal-ore and non-metal mineral mining industries during the period . Of this total, approximately 40 percent was generated by the copper mining industry alone.

The remaining rock is waste material and is dumped into tailings basins. The taconite powder with the iron in it is called concentrate. How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from

3.2 Mine Overburden and Waste Rock. Mining is largely divided into open-pit (surface) and underground mining. Open-pit is the most common technique in modern metal ore extraction. In open-pit metal extraction, the soil and vegetation are first removed from the mine site. Bulk ore is then blasted so as to loosen the bedrock.

Overburden. Waste rock or overburden refers to the often large mass of initial soil and rock that is removed to get to the valuable mineral deposits. Typically, for every ton of ore that is mined, 5 tons of overburden is displaced. Overburden is not subjected to any chemical processes but must be removed to access the ore underneath.
