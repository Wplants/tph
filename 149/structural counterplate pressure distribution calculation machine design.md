## Contact Pressure Distribution Under Foundations - The Constructor
Fig 3: C.P Distribution - Rigid Footing - Cohesive Soil. If the footing is resting on Cohesionless soils, contact pressure is maximum at center and gradually reduces to zero towards edges. Settlement is uniform in this case also. If the footing is embedded, then there may be some amount of contact pressure at the edges of rigid footing.

Retaining wall design could include any or all of loads and forces which are explained in the following sections: 1. Lateral Earth Pressure Acting on Retaining Wall. The main purpose of retaining wall construction is to retain soil; that is why soil lateral earth pressure is a major concern in the design. Sliding soil wedge theory is the basis

The structural design process begins with very general, sometimes "fuzzy," customer requirements that lead to clearly stated engineering design criteria with numbers attached. A summary of these general design criteria is shown in Figure 2.1.3. Beginning at the top of the "wheel" we have design loads. These loads include

## How To Calculate Pressure Die Casting Tonnage
In summary, the final calculation formula of die casting machine tonnage can be obtained: Clamping force> mold opening force × 1.1 = casting area × casting pressure = (cake area + runner area + product area + slag bag area) × casting pressure × 1.1. Die casting machine tonnage = clamping force/10, clamping force unit is KN.

pressure surrounding the element is initially equal to the ambient pressure Po, and it undergoes an instantaneous increase to a peak pressure Pso at the arrival time tA, when the shock front reaches that point. The time needed for the pressure to reach its peak value is very small and for design purposes it is assumed to be equal to zero.
