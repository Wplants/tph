## Technology: Solving the problem of plastic waste - Recycling Technologies
The RT7000 is our proprietary technology which transforms plastic waste into chemical feedstock, called Plaxx®, which can be used in the manufacture of new, virgin quality plastic. The machine uses a process called thermal cracking to break down long chains of polymers into shorter chains through the use of heat in the absence of oxygen.

Vacuum Forming: Variety of plastic shapes ii formed by vacuum forming method. In vacuum forming plastic is heated, stretched over the mold surface, and then vacuum force is applied. Polymer Casting: The resin is liquefied by heat. The melted rubber is filled closed in the mold and curd at room temperature.

The low reclamation rate may be due to mechanical recycling accounting for the majority of commercial PET recycling. Mechanical recycling yields a lower-quality recycled plastic than the process of chemically recycling back to the monomer phase, which can be energetically and economically expensive.

## Polymerization & Process - POLYMER ACADEMY
Polymerization. In polymer chemistry, polymerization is a process of reacting monomer molecules together in a chemical reaction to form polymer chains or three-dimensional networks. There are many forms of polymerization and different systems exist to categorize them. (An example of Alkene Polymerization, in which styrene monomer's double

However, unreacted residual monomers or small oligomers can be found in the plastic material since polymerization reactions are seldom complete. Their amounts in the products may vary between few parts per million to several percent depending on the polymer type and manufacturing process.

In condensation polymerization, the monomers react together to form dimers, and in this reaction process, water is released as a by-product—i.e. a hydrogen ion and a hydroxyl ion are lost in the bond formation process.

## The polymerisation process - ECVM
At the final stage of the S-PVC process, the miniscule particles of PVC are discharged from the polymerisation reactor, and stripped of un-reacted VCM. Most of the water is removed, usually by centrifugation, and the solid particles are dried. The end result is PVC in the form of a white powder, or resin, which is non-toxic, odourless and inert.

The process itself faces a number of chemical and engineering challenges, he notes. For example, the MMA monomers could easily repolymerize in the unit; there are flammability risks because the depolymerization occurs at conditions close to the self-ignition temperature of the monomer; and impurities generated in the process may compromise the polymerization process.

A monomer is smaller molecule that binds to other small molecules (other monomers) to make a larger molecule (polymer). Think of monomers as the simplest repeating unit (small molecule) in the makeup of a larger molecule. If the final plastic is made from a single type of monomer then it is classified as a homopolymer.

## Plastic
Etymology. The word plastic derives from the Greek πλαστικός (plastikos) meaning "capable of being shaped or molded," and in turn from πλαστός (plastos) meaning "molded." As a noun the word most commonly refers to the solid products of petrochemical-derived manufacturing.. The noun plasticity refers specifically here to the deformability of the materials used in the manufacture

## CO2 to Monomers - DTU Chemical Engineering
Apr 19, 2021T he project. This project develops a process for direct conversion of CO2, which could be captured from waste incineration, and H2, which could be obtained from water electrolysis, into light olefins and/or aromatics as plastic monomers or monomer precursors. Combining commercial high or ultra-high temperature water gas shift catalysts with
