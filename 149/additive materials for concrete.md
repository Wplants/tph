## Graphene Concrete Additives - Construction - First Graphene
Population growth and rapid urbanisation continue to boost the growth of concrete products but the industry faces major challenges notably the pressure to reduce the carbon footprint (CO 2 contribution) of cement-based products.. The use of graphene concrete additives can increase strength, reduce clinker factor in cements (reducing carbon footprint) and potentially increase longevity of products.

## The Xypex Concrete Waterproofing Advantage
Xypex is Different. The crystalline nature of the Xypex waterproofing system provides many application advantages over traditional barrier products. Xypex does not require a dry surface; in fact, a wet surface is necessary. Does not require dry weather to be applied. Xypex does not require costly surface priming or leveling prior to application.

## MIT students fortify concrete by adding recycled plastic
Concrete is, after water, the second most widely used material on the planet. The manufacturing of concrete generates about 4.5 percent of the world's human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. Replacing even a small portion of concrete with irradiated plastic could thus help reduce the cement industry's global carbon footprint.

## Is steel, wood or concrete the most 'green' building material?
Advocates for all three major construction materials lay claim to certain environmental merits. Steel can be essentially infinitely recycled and reused without degradation. Trees regrow, and lumber used in construction stores carbon dioxide. And new additives hold the potential to dramatically reduce concrete's staggering carbon footprint.
