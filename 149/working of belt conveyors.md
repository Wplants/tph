## Construction And Working of Belt Conveyor - Solution Pharmacy
May 10, 2021Working of Belt Conveyor: When power is applied to a conveyor, the belt starts rotating. As the pulley moves, the belt begins to travel in a forward direction, because of its close contact with the pulley. Snubber idlers also help in maintaining close contact between the pulley and belt.

There have been eight fatalities involving belt conveyors in the mining industry since January 26, 2017. Six involved miners working near moving conveyors, while two involved maintenance of an idle conveyor. All of these fatalities could have been prevented with proper lock-out/tag-out and blocking against motion before working.

Best Practices: Conveyor guarding should weigh 50 pounds or less. Guarding should have no sharp edges and should stand out in color from equipment it is guarding. To increase safety, guarding should require a tool to remove. Emergency stop switches need to be tested every 30 days and not span more than 70 feet between switches.

First of all, analyze the working principle of belt conveyor. Belt conveyor is mainly composed of two end rollers and a closed conveyor belt. The drum that drives the conveyor belt to turn is called the drive drum (drive drum). The other drum that simply changes the direction of the conveyor belt movement is called the redirecting drum.
