The benefit over recycled concrete is that it packs/stays in place better (the rough edges of the gravel end up interlocking in ways that makes them more stable). Suspect your trench will need to be deeper to deal with frost heave.

## What Can Be Use In Place Of Crusher Run Stone
Apr 01 2015 Crusher-run gravel compacts well but does not drain very fast -- at least not as fast as 34-inch crushed stone no fines. Talk to a soils engineer if you are worried -- but in my experience either crusher-run gravel compacted or 34-inch crushed stone can be used under footings. So can rigid foam. An engineer may disagree.
