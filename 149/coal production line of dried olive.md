Jan 7, 2021After drying, the moisture content goes down to 8-15 %. The dried olive residue was utilized since ancient times in the Mediterranean for cooking and heating. When burned directly, the energy stored in the olive pomace is transformed and released as heat. The calorific value of olive pomace is quite high and comparable to that of coal.
