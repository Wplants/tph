## Silver Mining in History - The Silver Institute
The story of silver mining began about 5,000 years ago. Silver was first mined around 3,000 BCE in Anatolia, now located in modern-day Turkey. The precious metal helped early civilizations in the Near East, Ancient Greece to flourish. In about 1,200 BCE the center of silver production shifted to Greece's Laurium mines, where it continued to

## Silver Mining in the United States - Legends of America
By Albert S. Bolles in 1879. Silver was one of the last of the mineral products to attain prominence in the mining industries of the United States. Prior to the year 1859, the silver produced in this country was utterly insignificant. Only faint traces of it had been found here and there, and it was rarely made the object of special exploration.

## Patio process
The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]
