## Jaw Crusher Liner Plate Design & Profile Shapes
These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.

## Design Of Jaw Crushers Used In Gold Mining
3. PRIMARY JAW CRUSHER. The first step of rock reduction process from large particles into small pieces is running them through a DOVE primary Jaw Crusher, a crusher that takes the rocks and crushes it smaller. DOVE Jaw Crushers have two opposing ribbed panels, or jaws, with one jaw moving forward and back to crush raw material against the fixed jaw.

## Jaw Crusher - Conmix Crusher
Jaw Crusher is widely used in industrial and mining enterprises, this is because the aircraft structure is relatively simple, and has a large range of models. Jaw Crusher is mainly used as the primary crusher. It can be used with mineral processing equipment, gravel ancillary equipment, it also can be used alone. Structure of Jaw Crusher is mainly include frame, eccentric shaft, big pulley
