jig's primary purpose is to provide repeatability, accuracy, and interchangeability in the manufacturing of products. A device that does both functions (holding the work and guiding a tool) is called a jig. An example of a jig is when a key is duplicated, the original is used as a jig so the new key can have the same path as the old one.

## Jigs and Fixtures: Definition, Types, Differences, Advantages 
The principle of location or the 3-2-1 principle, CAD tools (like ProE), and FEA tools (like ANSYS) are used for the design of the jigs as well as the fixtures. The jig is used for guiding the cutting tool (like a drill bit), and for doing so, jigs have components like a bush, which comes in contact with the cutting tool.

The drilling jig model forms part of the extensive course providing an introduction to technical drawing. The didactic approach involves teaching the systematic and transferable learning matter based on an operational mechanism. Comprehensive and well-structured instructional material supports wide-ranging use of the model in technical training.
