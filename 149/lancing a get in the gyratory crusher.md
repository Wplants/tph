## Gyratory and Cone Crusher - ScienceDirect
A primary gyratory crusher was required to crush iron ore at the rate of 3000 t/h. The largest size of the run-of-mine ore was 1000 mm. The required product size was less than 162 mm. Manufacturer's data indicated that the nearest size of gyratory crusher would be 1370 mm × 1880 mm with a cone angle of 18°.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

Jaw And Gyratory Crusher Construction. Gyratory crusher vs jaw crusher compared with the jaw crusher, its advantages are: the crushing process of the gyratory crusher is to rotate one circle along the annular crushing cavity, and it can work continuously at 360, while the main shaft of the jaw crusher rotates only 135 once, so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is.

Gyratory Crushers Gyratory crusher is generally used as a primary crusher. The crusher is popular due to its high throughput capacity and the large sized opening. The crusher is well suited for handling direct feed from haul/dump trucks. The gyratory crusher is mainly used in rock that is abrasive and/or has high compressive strength.
