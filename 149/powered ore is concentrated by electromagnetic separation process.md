## Electromagnetic separation is used in the concentration of: - Vedantu
Complete answer: Electromagnetic separation is the method to concentrate the ore or to remove unwanted materials like sand and clay from the ore. Magnetic or electromagnetic separation is the technique based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore or gangue. The particles that are attracted with the magnetic field are separated out.

## Iron can be concentrated from iron ore using electromagnetic separation.
Electromagnetic separation is applicable when either the ore particles or the impurities are magnetic (attracted by a magnet) in nature. This process can be used for the concentration of iron ore because iron is magnetic in nature.

either the ore or the gangue is magnetic. Electromagnetic separation. A process of removing magnetic materials from relatively nonmagnetic materials, using electromagnets which travel along a conveyor, over a drum, or into a revolving screen. So, from gangue and ore, one of them must be a magnetic material and other must be non-magnetic.

## Test: Metallurgy Process of Concentration of Ores
Detailed Solution for Test: Metallurgy Process of Concentration of Ores - Question 5. Electromagnetic separation method of concentration is employed when either the ore or the impurities associated with it are magnetic in nature. Tinstone or cassiterite (SnO 2) an ore of tin being non-magnetic can be separated from magnetic impurities (FeWO 4).

## Separation Of Ores
Magnetic separation process of ores: An electromagnetic separator is required. A leather or brass belt moves over two rollers, one of which encloses magnets in it. The powdered ore is dropped over this moving belt at one end. The non magnetic part of the ore is not attracted by the magnet and falls to form a separate heap at a distance.
