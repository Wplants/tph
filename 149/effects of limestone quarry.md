## What Happens When Limestone Is Mixed With Water? - Yes Dirt
When the limestone, CaCO₃, is placed in the water, carbon dioxide (CO₂) bubbles form. That is because calcium ions (Ca²+) react with carbonate ions in limestone (CO₃²-) to create calcium carbonate (CaCo3). The equation for this reaction is: 2 Ca + 2 CO 3 ↔ CaCO 3 + CO 2 ↑+ heat. Since more hydroxide ions are present than hydrogen

When the quarry is finished, the pumps are turned off and the water flows back in. When the water is exposed to the air, the CO2 degasses. This allows the pH to rise and for Calcium Carbonate to precipitate. The CaCO3 is very finely crystalline and remains suspended in the water column giving it that "Bahamian" blue color. One of the most popular rock quarries is the Eno near Durham, where

Limestone Month was created in 2007 to celebrate the rich heritage of limestone in Lawrence and Monroe Counties. All throughout June, you're invited to take part in tours through limestone quarries and architecturally-notable places, witness the craft of limestone carving at workshops, browse extensive collections at exhibitions, and join in on many other festivities.

## effects of limestone quarrying
The hydrogeological effect of limestone extraction from open pits (quarries) depends on the location of the site in the landscape, the vertical and horizontal extent of the excavation, the methods used to excavate the stone, and the extent of karstification. Groundwater quality is commonly affected by quarrying through increased fine sediment
