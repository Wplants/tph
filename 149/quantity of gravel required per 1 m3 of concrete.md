## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Aggregate required for 1 cubic meter 
Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags

Some of Mix is - 5.5. Where, M = Mix. 20 = Characteristic Compressive strength. Consider volume of concrete = 1m3. Dry Volume of Concrete = 1 x 1.54 = 1.54 m3 (For Dry Volume Multiply By 1.54) Now we start calculation to find Cement, Sand and Aggregate quality in 1 cubic meter of concrete.
