## Solvent extraction process for separation of zinc from cadmium
Zinc is separated from cadmium in aqueous chloride solution by subjecting the aqueous solution to a liquid/liquid extraction with an alkyl ester of phosphoric acid of general formula (CnH2n + 1)H(3- x)PO4 where nsF3 and x=1, 2 or 3 The ester, preferably tertiary butyl phosphate, may be used undiluted or alternatively as a solution in an inert solvent, eg xylene, kerosene or water-insoluble

## how to separate zinc and lead from ore
First of all, the ore must be concentrated to separate the lead ore from the zinc ore, for example. It turns out to be possible to do this with flotation. A substance is added that wets the zinc ore, allowing it to sink to the bottom, but does not wet the galena, allowing it to be caught up in a foam that floats on the surface of the water.

A rare element (about 0.2 gram per ton in Earth's crust), cadmium occurs in a few minerals and in small quantities in other ores, especially zinc ores, from which it is produced as a by-product. The chief zinc ore, zinc blende, or sphalerite, consists mainly of zinc sulfide, containing from 0.1 to 0.3 percent cadmium.
