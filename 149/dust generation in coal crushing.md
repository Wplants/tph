## The impacts of coal dust on miners' health: A review
Coal mining and processing involve multiple dust generation processes including coal cutting, transport, crushing and milling etc. Coal dust is one of the main sources of health hazard for the coal workers. Exposure of coal dusts can be prevented through administrative controls and engineering controls. Ineffective control of coal dust exposure
