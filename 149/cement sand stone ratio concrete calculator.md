## What is Water Cement Ratio And How To Calculate Water Cement Ratio
Oct 9, 2020Water Cement Ratio means the ratio between water weight to the weight of cement used in the concrete mix. Usually, the water-cement ratio falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS Code 10262 (2009) for nominal mix (M10, M15 .. M25) We all know that the water-cement ratio will directly affect the strength of concrete.Either it increases the strength if used in correct proportion or decrease it.

Mar 26, 2022There is a 1:2:3 ratio of bags of cement and sand and gravel in 1 cubic meter. As a general rule of thumb, you can approximate this by percentage: If the total number of units of cement and aggregates in 4.5 cubic meters of concrete at a 1:2:3 ratio is 6.

## What Is the Ratio of Portland Cement to Rock & Sand?
The ratios between cement, sand and gravel vary depending on the purpose of your concrete. For instance, a concrete mix for foundation walls or a base for paving slabs consists of one part Portland cement, 2.5 parts sand, 3.5 parts gravel and 0.5 parts water. For foundation footings, mix one part Portland cement, three parts sand and five parts

## How Much Portland Cement For One Yard Of Concrete?
Use a ratio of 3 parts sand to 1.5 parts cement. Adding hydrated lime to the mixture will reduce shrinkage cracks. It will also make the mortar more waterproof. If you add lime, the mixture will be 15 gallons of sand, 6.38 gallons of cement and 1.12 gallons of lime.
