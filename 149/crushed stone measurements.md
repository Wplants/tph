Jan 20, 2021Your calculations would look like this: 16 x 18 = 288 square feet. 4 x 8 = 32 square inches. 32 / 144 = 0.22 square feet. 288 / 0.22 = 1,310 pavers needed. And to find the amount of sand base, you would follow these steps: 16 x 18 = 288 square feet. 288 x 144 = 41,472 square inches. 41,472 x 2 = 82,944 cubic inches.
