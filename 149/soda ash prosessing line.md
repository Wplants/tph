The preparation of soda ash is generally done using one of four processes - the Leblanc process, the Dual-process, the Solvay process, and the Electrolytic process. Soda ash is a weak acid that is slightly soluble in ethanol and insoluble in alcohol. One of the important applications of this compound is as a water softener.

## Soda Ash Light | Dense - Beroil Energy
Dense soda ash is obtained from light soda ash by hydrating it to produce sodium carbonate monohydrate which is calcined to produce sodium carbonate (dense soda ash). Today, soda ash can be produced through natural or synthetic means. The Solvay Process is the dominant synthetic process. As of 2016, 70% of the world's soda ash is produced
