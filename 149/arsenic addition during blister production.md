Ganzhou is known as "the world's tungsten city", with its tungsten ores accounting for 39% of the reserves in China. The annual output of tungsten ores is approximately 2.5 × 10 4 t in Ganzhou, which is almost 20% of the production in China. Tungsten ores are mainly used for the production of ammonium paratungstate (APT), ferrotungsten, tungsten powder, and tungsten bars.

World production of arsenic kept rising until about the mid-1940s (in 1943 it was estimated at some 70 000 tonnes annually). As arsenic pesticides, specifically insecticides, were gradually replaced by other preparations, the production of arsenic declined. World production of arsenic in 1975 was about 60 000 tonnes (2).

Arsenic elimination was largely controlled by mass transfer in the gas phase. The kinetic analysis indicated that the arsenic evaporation rate was controlled by the combination of both liquid and gas-phase mass transfer only at a pressure of 8 Pa.
