Apr 8, . When any concrete structure, road, sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed instead of disposing of the demolition waste it should be crushed into high-quality aggregates, creating Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The benefit of recycling aggregate includes: Reduce the quantity of debris sent to landfill. Avoid disposal centres fees.

## Will Crushed Concrete Harden? (Find Out Now!) - Upgraded Home
Crusher run gravel (also known as "crush and run") is an aggregate made of fine gravel with larger pieces of limestone. This combination is similar to crushed concrete as it also compacts well and drains well. You can use crusher run for driveways, under concrete slabs, for walkways, and in other areas.

## Crushing it - Construction & Demolition Recycling
The sites that recycle concrete produce 2,000 tons of crushed concrete per day, while the sites that stabilize produce 7,000 tons per day. Crushers, screens, pugmills, loaders and excavators are used at all sites. The types of stabilized materials produced include portland cement, water, and either sand, recycled aggregate or natural aggregate.
