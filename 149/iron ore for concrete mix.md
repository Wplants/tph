## Iron Ore For Concrete Mix
The main active ingredient used to.Made by Replacing Sand by Iron Ore Slime Concrete cubes of size 100 x100 x100 mm were cast by replacing 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 of iron ore slime in concrete. The cubes were cured in water for 28 days. The compressive strengths of the cubes replacing sand by iron ore slime are given in Figure 3.

## Effects of Iron Ore Tailing on Performance of Hot-Mix Asphalt
Jan 1, 2022In Brazil, large quantities of iron ore tailings (IOT) are produced as a result of iron mining, which may affect the environment negatively. This work evaluated the use of IOT in hot mix asphalt type C (HMA-C). For this purpose, IOT was incorporated as a filler (at 1% in relation to the total mass of HMA-C).

## Which form of iron provides better uniformity of mix for concrete?
A. Typically concrete that is used for shielding has a density of about 2.35 g cm -3. Iron or aggregates containing iron such as magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) or hematite (Fe 2 O 3) are added to concrete to increase its density. The effective atomic number of the concrete also increases and the combined effect is an increase in attenuation.
