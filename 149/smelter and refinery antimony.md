Nov 28, 2016· MIT's accidental smelting discovery unlocks the potential of antimony. The ancient Egyptians used it in black eye make-up and alchemists marvelled at antimony's semi-metallic properties. Now, a groundbreaking smelting technique could open up new opportunities for antimony, as well as other metals. Nnamdi Anyadike investigates.

## SPOTLIGHT: Chinese smelters pump efforts into antimony - Metal Bulletin
Chinese antimony smelters are upgrading facilities, focussing on environmental protection, and stepping up efforts to secure raw material supplies. While producers are currently bearish about the near-term outlook, Lengshuijiang smelters have made considerable efforts to improve their facilities, as well as to secure raw material supply

## Antimony smelting process generating solid wastes and dust 
Metallic antimony with a purity of 99.4% is obtained when the antimony oxide is reduced in a reverberatory furnace at 1200°C by reducing coal. During the refining process in a reverberatory furnace, any As accompanying the antimony oxide is removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide. AAR is generated during the As removal process.
