The crushed aggregates (W2) is expressed as % of the total weight of sample (W1), which is the crushing value of the aggregate. Aggregate crushing value = (W1/W2)100. Recommended Values: In aggregate crushing test, if aggregate crushing value is less than 10, it signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate. While aggregate crushing value above
