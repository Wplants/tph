## screening crushing of iron ore
Iron ore crushing plant, iron ore beneficiation and mining, Iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse Common iron ore crushers are jaw crusher, cone crusher and fine jaw crusher

Crushing. As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch).  If the lump ore is of the appropriate quality, it can be charged to the blast furnace without any further processing. Fines, however, must first be agglomerated,
