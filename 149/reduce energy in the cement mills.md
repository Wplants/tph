The direct CO 2 intensity of cement production increased about 1.5% per year during . In contrast, 3% annual declines to 2030 are necessary to get on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Sharper focus is needed in two key areas: reducing the clinker-to-cement ratio (including through greater uptake of blended cements) and deploying innovative technologies, such as

## reduce energy in the cement mills
Reducing energy consumption of a raw mill in cement industry. During grinding process the energy obtained from the rotary burner is consumed. In this study the first and second law analysis of a raw mill is performed and certain measures are implemented in an existing raw mill in a cement factory in order to reduce the amount of energy consumption in grinding process.
