##  Partial Replacement of River Sand with Robosand - ijirt
The study of replacement of river sand in concrete with rock sand that the suitability of Crushed Rock fine (CRF) to replace river sand in concrete production for use in rigid pavement was investigated. Strength tests are studied with River sand and Artificial Sand, for Low grade concrete and high grade concrete.

## Replacement Of River Sand With Rock Dust
Crushed Rock Sand Sciencedirect. Several studies have been conducted in the past to investigate the effect of partial replacement of natural river sand with crushed rock sand. celik and marar 1996 concluded that partial replacement upto 30 leads to decrease in slump value. however,ignificant improvement in the compressive, flexural strength and impact resistance was observed.
