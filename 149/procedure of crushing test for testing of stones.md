## Crushing Test or Compression strength Test on stone - Expert Civil
The Crushing strength or compressive strength is given by the formula as: C= P/A. Where, C = compressive strength. P = Load at failure. A = cross-sectional area of bearing face of the specimen. Then the average value of the six specimens is calculated and the result is recorded for that stone sample. You may also like.
