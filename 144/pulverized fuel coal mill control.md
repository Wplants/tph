Pulverized fuel ash is formed during the process of combustion of pulverised coal in the furnace of the power station's boiler. The coal is ground to powder-coal in coal mills, before being blown by compressed air into the furnace and burned at temperatures ranging between 1300 and 1600 °C, depending on the type of boiler in question.
