## JB STONE - Home
Born from molten magma, granite is a much more durable and functional stone than marble. Granite's crystalline structure is far more resistant to abrasions, staining and discoloration than most marbles. Denser and stronger than all natural stones, granite is an excellent choice for high traffic areas where class and style is desired.
