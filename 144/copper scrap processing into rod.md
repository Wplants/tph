## What is Scrap Metal Recycling Process
Scrap metal recycling involves the recovery and processing of scrap metal from end-of-life products as well as from manufacturing scrap, so that it can be introduced into new goods. Scrap metal recycling involves a number of steps such as recovery, sorting, brokering, baling, shearing, smelting, etc., which is shown in the following part. 1.

Copper cathode is produced through the refining process, which helps in the removal of impurities from copper ore. Based on refining process type, the copper cathode market can be segmented into smelting and electro-refining.
