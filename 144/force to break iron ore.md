What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

## How much force does it require to tear apart steel, iron and concrete 
In the link we can see that iron has a tensile strength of 350 MPa, which means that it takes a force of 350 million Newton to pull apart a one square meter thick column of iron. Concrete is listed at 2-5 MPa and steel between 400 and 2700 MPa. It should be noted that while concrete doesn't resist tension well, it does resist compression well.

In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.24­0.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
