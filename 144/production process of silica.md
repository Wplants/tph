## Silica-gel Manufacturer | Fuji Silysia Chemical
The term silica-gel is derived from the manufacturing method, sol-gel, to produce this material. Two raw materials, sodium silicate and mineral acid, are used in a wet process to create a reaction in generating monomeric silicic acid. These monomers polymerize to generate primary silica particles, referred to as silica sol.

## Sodium Silicate - Production and Uses - WorldOfChemicals
The production process of sodium silicate is based on batch-wise operations. Sodium silicate can be produced by dissolving silica in molten sodium carbonate. It can also be produced in a reactor, by treating a mixture of caustic soda, water and silica in the form of quartz sand with hot steam. The chemical compound can be also be produced from

## Silica processing methods - LZZG
Silica processing methods. Posted: Silica sand is much demand for glass producing, especially with the high pureness. Silica processing methods are mainly through crushing, sieving, washing and drying natural quartz stone to get finished products for widely used in glass, casting, ceramics and refractory materials, metallurgy, construction, chemicals, plastics, rubber, abrasives and

## production process of silica
A process for the production of a precipitated silica, said process comprising simultaneously adding alkali silicate with a weight modulus SiO 2:alkali oxide=2.5-3.9:1 and a mineral acid to an initial amount of water, which has been adjusted to a pH value of 7.0 to 9.9 or 10.0 to 10.7 by the addition of water glass, to form a mixture, holding
