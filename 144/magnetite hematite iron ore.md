Aug 31, 2022What is magnetite ore? Mineral magnetite actually has a higher iron content than the mineral hematite. However, while hematite ore usually contains high concentrations of hematite, magnetite ore tends to contain low concentrations of magnetite. As a result, this type of iron ore must be concentrated before it can be used to make steel.

Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant in deposits in most parts of the world. Despite the fact that hematite is iron containing, it has a very weak or nonexistent magnetic field because of the way its iron atoms align.

## What is the difference between magnetite and hematite iron ore?
Why is magnetite magnetic but not hematite? "Magnetizing" Hematite True hematite, though iron-containing, actually has a weak magnetic field because of the way its iron atoms are aligned. Like true hematite, magnetite is also an iron oxide, but its iron atoms are arranged in a manner that make it magnetic. Which ore is related to hematite

## Hematite
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t, ˈ h ɛ m ə-/), also spelled as haematite, is a common iron oxide compound with the formula, Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).With this it forms a

## How is haematite different from magnetite?f
Score: 4.9/5 (35 votes) . The key difference between magnetite and hematite is that the iron in magnetite is in +2 and +3 oxidation states whereas, in hematite, it is only in +3 oxidation state. Magnetite and hematite are minerals of iron. Both have iron in different oxidation states, and they are in the forms of iron oxides.

## Why magnetite iron ore?tankandlift
Score: 4.4/5 (34 votes) . Magnetite ore's most distinctive property is its magnetism.It is the most magnetic mineral in the world. Additionally, obtaining iron from hematite ore can produce a great deal of carbon emissions, and the process for magnetite is much less harmful.

## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral - Geology
Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world. Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.
