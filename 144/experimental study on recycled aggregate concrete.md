## An experimental study on the effect of recycled aggregate on concrete 
In this experimental study, the effect of the recycled aggregate on interfacial property, permeability and strength characteristics of the concrete was evaluated in order to examine the relationship between the recycled aggregate and the performance of the hardened concrete. Five types of recycled aggregate and four levels of w/c ratio were tested. The effect of the recycled aggregate was

## Experimental study on reuse of recycled concrete aggregates for load 
Recycled aggregates recovered from abandoned buildings or demolished concrete structures were reused to produce concrete columns as new building components. A quasi-static test on 10 recycled aggregate concrete filled steel tubular (RACFST) columns was carried out. The mechanical properties of RACFST columns in the study include failure mode, hysteretic loops, skeleton curves, stiffness
