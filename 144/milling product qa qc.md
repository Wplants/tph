QC is hugely concerned with thoroughness. They also play the percentages. QC will have what's called an acceptable quality limit, which is the percentage of products that are allowed to fail inspection. For most jobs, the acceptable quality limit looks like this: Critical Defects: 0%. Major Defects: 2.5%. Minor Defects: 4%.
