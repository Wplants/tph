## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

There are different types of grinding machines, as well as many different scenarios where precision metal grinding can be used.  For instance, for grinding parts with a diameter of 0.250" (6.35 mm) or smaller, ask about their ability to deliver tight tolerances using centerless grinding methods. Ask about their metal grinding equipment.
