The mixing of sulfuric acid and phosphate creates gypsum (called phosphogypsum) as a byproduct. Although gypsum can be used for a variety of purposes, the EPA prevents usage of Florida's phosphogypsum because it retains low levels of radioactivity found in the host sediments. At present, phosphogypsum is piled up around the processing plant.
