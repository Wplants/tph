## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Iron Ore Magnetic Separation - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The largest development in the iron-ore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used.  The separate determinations of iron as magnetite, and total iron, were made so that

## How do you seperate iron from clay? | Physics Forums
Iron ore can come with different impurities, some good for steel (V, Ti) and some bad (Mg, Na), and what these impurities are will dictate what the iron ore's used for. At my job we process iron for steel making and sell it to be fired in a smelter at a grade to be used for steel frames. We don't have the capacity, money or materials to make it

## Archaeometallurgical slag
Archaeometallurgical slag is slag discovered and studied in the context of archaeology.Slag, the byproduct of iron-working processes such as smelting or smithing, is left at the iron-working site rather than being moved away with the product.As it weathers well, it is readily available for study. The size, shape, chemical composition and microstructure of slag are determined by features of the
