## Jaw crushers for your primary crushing - Voghel
Jaw crushers are primary crushers, rock crushing equipment and other hard and abrasive materials, such as granite, ores or recycled concrete, usually for industrial use. The crushing device consists of a fixed plate and a swivel plate called a jaw. The rock is trapped and crushed between the jaw teeth.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

## What Is a Jaw Crusher? Here's How It Works - Cutting Technologies
All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one. These two form a V-shaped chamber, where the materials are fed. The movable jaw will move back and forth against the fixed one, compressing all materials in the space between. The mobile jaw's movement will not be fixed from side-to-side. Instead, it moves in an elliptical motion with

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing
