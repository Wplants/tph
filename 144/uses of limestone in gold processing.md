## Limestone uses — Science Learning Hub
Calcium oxide, obtained from limestone, acts as a pH regulator when extracting gold from quartz. The chemical extraction of gold from powdered quartz rock uses a solution of sodium cyanide. In this cyanidation process, the pH of the solution needs to be maintained between 10-11 to prevent the production of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas.
