## Diamonds and All That - The Contribution of Mining to South Africa
This year, 2017, is the 150th anniversary of the discovery of diamonds in South Africa. Actually, that is probably not strictly true, as diamonds might have been discovered earlier by people who never put them to commercial use. But the discovery of the fi rst diamond on the banks of the Orange River near Hopetown in 1867 sparked off the development of mining in the country.

So while there is less associated environmental harm, there are still serious short- and long-term risks with the four diamond mining processes: 1. Open Pit Mining. Layers of earth and rock are first removed and the ore beneath is blasted to allow for removal. The rough material is loaded onto trucks and transported to an industrial crusher.
