There are many "toxic relationships" covered in season 2 of Euphoria such as Cassie and Nate, Nate and Maddy, Cal and Ashtray, and others. Everybody is distorted wanting something while doing something else. Sex, life, love, and addiction are what rule everyone. Nobody is considering heart and emotions in their decisions.

## Belt Conveyor Idler Spacing - Martin Eng
The spacing between the rolling components has a dramatic effect on the idlers' support and shaping missions. Idlers placed too far apart will not properly support the belt nor enable it to maintain the desired profile. Placing idlers too close together will improve belt support and profile, but will increase conveyor construction costs and

## Conveyor Belt Idlers: Essential Parts Under the Belt
Conveyor belt idlers are rollers used with certain spacing beneath both the carrying and return sides of the belt. As bulk material is loaded onto the belt, the idlers support it along its full length to keep it from stretching, sagging, and eventually failing. In doing so, the idlers allow bulk material to be transferred more evenly from one

## Research on the Idler Spacing of Belt Conveyor | Scientific.Net
Roller is a crucial component with regard to belt conveyor system, which supports belts and cargos. In the design of the belt conveyor, a third of major consumption went into rollers. The critical consideration for minimum cost, which including operating, manufacturing, maintenance expenditure, is the selection of idler spacing.

## Belt Conveyor Idlers - IspatGuru
Sep 25, 2021Return idler spacing - The suggested normal spacing of return idlers for general belt conveyor work is also given in Tab 1. For conveyor belts with heavy carcasses, and with a width of 1,200 mm or more, it is recommended that the return idler spacing be determined by the use of the idler load ratings and belt sag considerations.
