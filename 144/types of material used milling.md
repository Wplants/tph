Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## Types of Chips Formed During CNC Milling
Dec 17, 2021The following are a few popular types of chips in CNC milling. Discontinuous Chips: Discontinuous chips possess non-homogeneous shape and they generally deform due to repeated fracturing. . Work pieces made of hard and fragile metals like cast iron, brass, and bronze are known to produce discontinuous chips.

To harden the material, the samples were kept for 2 h in an autoclave at a temperature of 177 °C and a pressure of 0.3 MPa. The final stage of sample preparation was a peripheral milling operation. This type of milling is used to obtain samples with precisely defined dimensions as well as surfaces free from sharp and irregular edges.

The Rosa alba L. and Rosa damascena Mill. growing in Bulgaria are known for their extremely fine essential oil and valuable hydrosols. Irrespectively of its wide use in human life, little research exists on the cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of the hydrosols. This set our goal to conduct cytogenetic analyses to study these effects. A complex of classical cytogenetic methods was applied in
