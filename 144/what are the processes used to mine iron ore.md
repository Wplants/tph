## A Review on Novel Techniques for Chalcopyrite Ore Processing
2.2. Chalcopyrite Ore Processing. The first step in the chalcopyrite processing is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents such as alumina, limestone, pyrite and silica so that the copper and non-ferrous mineral values are concentrated into a product containing between 20 to 30 percent copper.

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed. The aim of this is to reduce the undesirable high proportion of admixtures to a desired minimum in order to increase the iron content. This is done by processes such as flotation or magnetic separation.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
