## Melting behaviour of sponge iron in induction furnace - eprints@NML
Sponge iron with its consistency of composition, lower content of tramp elements and particularly low phosphorus and of sulphur has drawn the attention of medium/large scale foundries for producing quality steel castings. It is one of the alternative charge materials to scrap in induction furnaces. National Metallurgical Laboratory has made an attempt to melt sponge iron in induction furnaces

DRI, also known as sponge iron, is the product of reducing iron oxide in the form of iron ore and steel plant wastes into metallic iron, below the melting point of iron and typically in the range of °C. Iron oxide is charged into shaft furnace, rotary kiln, or fluidized beds in the form of pellet, iron ore lumps, or fines.

## Production of Steel in Induction Furnace - IspatGuru
The induction furnace for melting sponge iron is required to have a large ratio of cross sectional area to volume so that the heat transfer is high and to keep the slag hot and fluid. The induction furnace uses the transformer principle of induction, i.e. when an electrical conductor is placed in a fluctuating magnetic field then a voltage is
