## Mining Approaches for Sand & Gravel - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.
