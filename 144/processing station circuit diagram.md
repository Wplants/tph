## The Comprehensive Guide to Process Flow Diagrams & Process Flowcharts 
A process flow diagram or PFD is a technical type of flowchart that helps managers or designers organize a process that creates a clear output. In business, when you have to explain a project or walk through a process, you've probably turned to flowcharts. After all, they're an effective way to show individual steps in a process.
