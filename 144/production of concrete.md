## Concrete! Components and Production of Concrete - Civil Rack
The basis for mixing by volume is usually one part of concrete in n parts of sand and 2 parts of ballast. Ballast is usually double compared to sand. The cement/sand ratio depends on the desired strength of the concrete. The ratio is lower when high strength is required. The volume of a 50 kg bag of cement is 34.5 litres.

## Concrete
Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens.
