## China's potash demand stirs resistance in rural Thailand
China owes its expansion of agricultural production in part to cheap fertilisers. The country is the world's largest consumer of potash, a potassium-rich salt that boosts yields and enhances the water retention and disease resistance of crops. Chinese farmers depend on potash imports mainly from Canada, Russia and Belarus.

The solids typically include iron sulfides. The distribution of H 2 S between water and gas depends on the pH, the temperature and the salinity of the pond water and brine. For potash solution mining, when the pond water is re-injected into the deep salt-bearing formation to extract potash, various microorganisms feed off the organic matter.

brine or salt and water solution. It is then circulated throughout the mine workings to dissolve potash and salt from the original pillars and walls. The brine is pumped to an evaporation pond. Submersible pumps are used, each pumping about 9,000 liters per minute.5 As the liquid cools, the potash and salt crystals settle to the bottom of the pond.
