## Sorting through the heap - Canadian Mining Journal
One of the advantages of heap leaching versus conventional milling and using either carbon-in-pulp (CIP) or carbon-in-leach (CIL) for gold recovery is the lower cost. However, along with that lower cost comes a lower recovery rate. Gold recovery is also usually only about 55% to 75% compared with roughly 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant.
