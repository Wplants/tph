## The magic of bolting for a grinding mill assembly - Metso Outotec
A 22-foot ball mill being assembled with bolts. From a distance, a grinding mill may not be an impressive piece of machinery. At first glance, all it seems to do is turn and turn at a constant speed. However, grinding mills play a critical role in minerals processing, with large mills often processing over $1 million worth of ore per day.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
Smaller plants tend to add extra crushing stages in order to operate a single grinding stage only. If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter.
