## Field compaction equipment - Analysis and design of  - Ebrary
Equipment such as the one represented in Figure 10.12 is known as a pneumatic roller, and can reach up to 100 tons in total weight. They are appropriate for a wide range of soils, from clean sands to low-plasticity silty clays. The contact area of each tire with the soil and the pressure transmitted through this area are determinant for compaction.

Impact Compaction The equipment used for impact compaction are tamping rollers and rammers. Impact reduces the internal friction of soil and particles start moving towards voids easily. (Dropping an object from a height of 20 cm produces a compaction 50 times larger than the static force produced by the same object.)

## Compaction of Soil - Uses and Effects of Soil Compaction
Compaction is the application of mechanical energy to a soil to rearrange the particles and reduce the void ratio. The principal reason for compacting soil is to reduce subsequent settlement under working loads. As water is added to a soil ( at low moisture content) it becomes easier for the particles to move past one another during the application of the compacting

Figure 1. Soil compaction is defined as the method of mechanically increasing the density of soil. In construction, this is a significant part of the building process. If performed improperly, settlement of the soil could occur and result in unnecessary maintenance costs or structure failure. Almost all types of building sites and construction

## The Importance of Soil Compaction in Construction
Soil compaction equipment comes in a variety of styles with different options such as single or double drums, vibratory mechanisms or dozer blades.  Clay and silt feel smooth when moist and retain relatively high amounts of water. The proper equipment choice for a particular soil type can drastically improve the ending degree of compaction.

The value of void ratio depends on the consistence and packing of the soil. It is directly affacted by compaction. Some typical values of void ratio for different soils are given below only as general guidelines.

Compaction occurs when the soil parti-cles moved into closer fitting arrange-ments. Water is the lubricant which facilitates the movement. Thus play under wet conditions when the soil is near satu-ration ismore likely to lead to compaction than when the soil is dry. Drainage to remove excess water rapidly from the root zone is the one step which may be taken to assist in long.

Compaction helps to reduce the settlement, permeability, seepage, etc. During compaction, air is expelled from the void spaces in the soil mass which increases the density. Compaction generally increases the shear strength, bearing capacity and makes the soil more stable against the structure failure. 2. Meaning of Soil Compaction: Compaction

When compacting clay soils, you would want to use a rammer or a vibrating Sheepsfoot as they provide excellent compaction for clay soil.

Both of these action provide an impact method of compaction.

First, the most effective way to minimize soil compaction is to avoid field operations when soil moisture is at or near field capacity. Soil compaction will be less severe when soil tillage, fertilizer application and planting operations occur when the field is dry. Soil moisture can be determined using a hand ball test or observing a soil

## Compaction properties of different soils and suitable solutions
The compaction properties of gravel and sand are influenced by the water content; compaction is most effective when there is ideal water content. If the fine content is less than 5 to 10%, the soil is considered free draining. In free-draining soils, excess water is drained off during compaction. This means that, in certain circumstances, the
