Zinc oxide is prepared commercially by two methods: the American (or direct) process, which uses zinc ore and concentrate, and the French (or indirect) process, which uses zinc metal. Some 54% of US zinc oxide production is from zinc ore and concentrate (American process), 33% from slab zinc (French process) and 13% from secondary material.
