Therefore, the wet grinding method came into being. The powder obtained by grinding with a wet grinding machine is a very effective and economical method. Wet grinding also avoids the high cost of chemical nano-powder manufacturing, and avoids the insufficiency of mechanical dry grinding that the fineness is difficult to achieve nano-scale powder.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

While dry milling is less capital intensive, it also yields less ethanol per bushel of corn than wet milling (Rajagopalan, et al., 2005). Wet milling involves steeping the corn for up to 48 hours to assist in separating the parts of the corn kernel. Processing the slurry separates the germ from the rest of the kernel, which is processed further
