Secondary manufacturing processes are those processes that are done after the initial manufacturing processes—like injection molding, CNC machining production, and so on. There are many different types of secondary processes that can be used with workpieces, depending on your specific needs and requirements.

## Secondary Battery - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Introduction. The storage battery, secondary battery, or charge accumulator is a cell or combination of cells in which the cell reactions are reversible. This means that the original chemical conditions within the cell can be restored by passing current to flow into it: that is, by charging from an external source.

## Production Process: Definition, Types & Examples - StudySmarter US
The production process is defined as the process in which the 'factors of production', i.e. input of resources, are turned into beneficial output. Mass production is when there is continuous production and all employees work to produce the same items at the same time. Batch production is similar to mass production.
