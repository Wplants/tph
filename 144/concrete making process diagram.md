## Concrete: Manufacturing Process - BrainKart
Concrete may be placed underwater with the help of bottom dump buckets. The concrete is taken through the water in water- tight bucket. On reaching the place of deposition the bottom of the bucket is made to open and the concrete is dumped. In this process certain amount of cement is washed away causing a reduction in strength of concrete.
