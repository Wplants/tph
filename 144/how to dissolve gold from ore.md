The reason why halogens and their compounds can be used as non-cyanide gold recovery chemical is that the oxidation potential when halogens become halogen ions is high enough to dissolve gold. In acidic medium (pH <1), sodium chlorate or chlorine gas is used as oxidant to dissolve gold. The reaction formula is: 3/2Cl2+Au+Cl-→AuCl4-.

Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.

If you want to leach gold you need an oxidizing environment (add chlorine gas or clorox) until you reach an ORP of 1000mV, at a Ph of about 5, hopefully warm temperature and you will leach gold. Once in solution, separate liquid from solids, reduce the ORP to 100 -500 mV using NaHSO3 and your gold will precipitate.
