## Asbestos History and Ban in Canada | MAA Center
Canada first began mining asbestos in the 1870s, and so began the economic boom that came along with it. For 50 years, asbestos was mined, manufactured, and sold in a multitude of products used all over the country, and the rest of the world. Then, in the 1920s, the first concerns about the "dust disease" infecting many of the workers who

Asbestos minerals also occur naturally in rocks, saprolite, and soil. Naturally occurring asbestos that has been disturbed by human activities can be a health concern. Studies from California and Wyoming found that asbestos fibers released into the atmosphere from mining and quarrying posed a direct health threat to the nearby population.

Jun 22, 2022Asbestos mining may have ceased, but the damage has already been done for workers in those mines— decades after exposure and inhaling asbestos fibers, many miners developed illnesses like asbestosis and mesothelioma. Those who continued working in asbestos mines through their closings in 2002 are still at risk of receiving a diagnosis.
