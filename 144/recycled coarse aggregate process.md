## Performance Evaluation of Strengthening Recycled Coarse Aggregate in 
As can be seen from Table 3, the apparent density and water absorption rate of recycled fine aggregate are, respectively, smaller and higher than those of natural fine aggregate.The water absorption rate of recycled fine aggregate is 75.65% greater than that of natural fine aggregate. This is mainly because the recycled fine aggregate is composed of some stones in the crushing process and

## Influence of amount of recycled coarse aggregates and production 
In this study recycled coarse aggregates obtained by crushed concrete were used for concrete production. Four different recycled aggregate concretes were produced; made with 0%, 25%, 50% and 100% of recycled coarse aggregates, respectively. The mix proportions of the four concretes were designed in order to achieve the same compressive strengths.

## Characterization of Recycled Coarse Aggregate (RCA) via a Surface 
Recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) made from waste concrete is not a suitable structural material as it has high absorption of cement mortar, which adheres on the aggregate surface and on the tiny cracks thereon. Therefore, when using RCA made from waste concrete, much water must be added with the concrete, and slump loss occurs when transporting. Hence, its workability is significantly worse

## Properties of Concrete Using Treated Low-Class Recycled Coarse 
Recycled coarse aggregate (RG) was obtained from a prestressed concrete pile which had been crushed in a jaw crusher. Details of original concrete mix was unclear and further treatment was not carried out.  This process was defined as one cycle, and until 60% or less, or until 10 cycles were reached. Equation (1) is used to calculate the
