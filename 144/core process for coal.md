## How Is Coal Formed - A Process Spanning Eras | Planète Énergies
How Is Coal Formed - A Process Spanning Eras. Like oil and natural gas, coal is a fossil fuel. It started forming over 350 million years ago, through the transformation of organic plant matter. It all starts with a swamp on the edge of a sedimentary basin, such as a lagoon or a lake. Tectonic activity raises sea levels, covering and killing

If coal is high in sulfur or other impurities, it is washed with a water or chemical bath, removing up to 40 percent of inorganic sulfur in the coal. Not all coal is prepared using the same process. High-sulfur coal commonly undergoes washing to meet environmental regulations, while low-sulfur coal is often crushed and resized without being washed.

DFDS system uses high pressure of air (about 3-4 bar) and low pressure of water (about 2-3bar),which generates dry fog and being sprayed at the point of dust generation .The spray angle covers 30 to 90 degree.

## Diamond Core Drilling: Theory, Mechanisms and Applications
Diamond drilling allows for the removal of solid cylinders of rock (core) from deep within the earth. Drill Structure. The term diamond core drilling comes from the 'diamond bit' drill used during this process. This drill bit is made up of a group of small, industrial-grade diamonds set into a metallic, soft matrix.

## Coal
The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called coalification.At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. In these wetlands, the process of coalification began when dead plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water, and was converted into peat.This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs

Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.
