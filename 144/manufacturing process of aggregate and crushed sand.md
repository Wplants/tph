The sand must be of proper gradation ( it should have particles from 150 microns to 4.75 mm proper proportion). Manufacture of the sand process involves three stages, crushing of stones into aggregates by VSI, then fed to Rotopactor to crush aggregates into sand to required grain size. Screening is done to eliminate dust particles and Washing
