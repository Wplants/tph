## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Types, Operations (With PDF)
Milling Machine Definition. The milling machine is defined as perhaps most widely used in manufacturing industries after the lathe machine.. However, In the case of lathe machine tools, the tools used there single-point cutting tools but In the case of this machine, the tool used is multi-point cutting tools.. The milling is a process of metal-removing by feeding the workpiece passes through
