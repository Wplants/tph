## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %). Normally pellets are reduced considerably faster than sinter
