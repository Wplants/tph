## History of Coal in India - Green Clean Guide
The early coal mine is documented in ancient China. It is a known fact that coal has played an important role in the industrial revolution, where it was primarily used to produce thermal energy and power steam engines. Coal has been mined in India since 1774, pioneered by the East India Company at Raniganj Coalfield, bank of Damodar River.
