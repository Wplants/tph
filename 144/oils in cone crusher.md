During the operation of the cone crusher, the oil pressure of the thin oil smooth system is generally 0.05～0.15MPa, while the corresponding cooler water pressure of the thin oil smooth system is generally 0.025～ 0.08 MPa. When the lubricating system shows some problems, it may cause the oil pressure to be low.
