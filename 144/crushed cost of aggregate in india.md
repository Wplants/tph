## Recycled Aggregate Concrete: Applications, Advantages  - Happho
Reduces the amount of virgin aggregates to be created, hence less evacuation of natural resources. While being crushed into smaller particles a large amount of carbon dioxide is absorbed. This reduces the amount of CO 2 is the atmosphere. Cost saving - few research studies have shown a significant reduction in construction costs if RAC is used.
