## Top Recycled Building Materials That Are Changing the World
Barn Wood. Barn wood is a popular recycled material in the US. Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, barns were build using a mix of lumber (usually what's found on the owner's land). Most of these old buildings are now being torn down and what's left usable is a cheap building material for new constructions.

Many of the challenges in processing construction and demolition waste are caused by the variable properties of the materials. By nature, the waste generated at demolition sites is bulky and often heavy, which increases transportation costs. Reducing the waste to smaller and uniform grain size makes it easier and faster to handle.
