## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.

In 2012, using a HGT6089 gyratory crusher, the raw material crushing efficiency can reach more than 3,300 t/h. If continuous full-cavity feeding is realized, the processing capacity of t/h can be easily achieved. The HGT6089 gyratory crusher only runs for 15 hours a day, which can meet the daily demand of 50,000 tons of ore.

A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
