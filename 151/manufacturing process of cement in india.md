Cement production. In India, the emissions intensity of cement production decreased by 32.4 kg CO2/tonne of cement (a decrease of only 5 percent) between 2010 and 2017. While clinker substitution is responsible for much of the reduction in emissions intensity, use of alternative fuels in the clinker production process has been limited so far.
