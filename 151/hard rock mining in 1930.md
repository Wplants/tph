## Prospecting for Hard Rock Gold - March 2010 (Vol. 79, No. 7) - ICMJ
One area I feel that offers some potential is the hard rock vein systems, and particularly the old hard rock mines and their mill sites and old dumps.  The dump was about 80 feet long and 10 feet wide. It was full of old cans and 1930-type bottles. It was obvious they were here for a long time. Maybe under the dump was another from the late

Placer gold mining was soon joined by hard rock mining, as prospectors followed the gold to its source veins in the mountains.  Mining revived in the early 1930s in response to the increase in the price of gold from $20 to $35 per ounce, but then virtually shut down during World War II when gold mining was declared non-essential to the war
