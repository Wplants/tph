In this treatment process, mercury, salt, and copper sulfate were used to isolate silver from its native ore. The process was typical from the 1600s through the 1800s. These days it is generally avoided due to safety concerns. Silver is now refined by using various means, including but not limited to: chemical leaching; electrolytic refinement

The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
