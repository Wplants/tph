## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.

Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.

## Dust emission from crushing of hard rock aggregates
All processes of aggregate production are potential sources of dust emission. Dust constitutes a major environmental concern in many quarries, with crushing suggested as the most significant source of it ( Bada et al., 2013; Petavratzi et al., 2005; Sairanen et al., 2018 ). Dust from drilling has been previously examined in two natural stone
