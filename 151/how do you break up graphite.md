## What temperature is required to burn pencil lead graphite?
Pencil lead will not burn effectively for the first reason as clay is non-combustible and smothers any fire load. If you did have pure graphite to burn, a simple flame wouldn't be hot enough to combust it. You need to sustain temperatures of around 1000 − 2000 ∘ C in order for pure carbon to burn. Share.
