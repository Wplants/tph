1. The definition of screw conveyor. The screw conveyor is commonly known as the auger, and the screw conveyor uses the rotating screw blade to push the material for the screw conveyor. The force that the material does not rotate with the screw conveyor blades is the material's own weight and the frictional resistance of the screw conveyor

## Screw Conveyor Design, Application and Selection Guidelines, History - USA
The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane. The screw conveyor began to evolve in the late 1800s and was used as a means of increasing food and grain production to meet the needs of the rapidly growing American population. The first feed mills used screw conveyors throughout the process.

For this reason the weighing screw conveyor must be feed via a rotary valve or a second screw. To prevent that the product is „thrown over", the screw should be filled to a defined degree only. Furthermore, the screw volume (length and cross-section of the screw) must remain in sensible relationship with the tare-weight.
