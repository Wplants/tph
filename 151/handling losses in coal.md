## Coal waste: handling, pollution impacts and utilization
Poland is still one of the major producers of hard (bituminous) coal in the world and is currently still the largest producer in the EU. 1 In the 1980s, annual production was about 200 Mt, but from 1990 onwards, hard coal production in Poland started to decrease, so that by 2008 it was only 84 Mt. At the present it is close to 80 Mt and there
