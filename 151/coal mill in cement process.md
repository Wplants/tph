## cement mill grinding process
The coal mill grinding system is an important part of the dry process cement manufacturing. In cement plants, we usually adopt the air swept coal mill system or vertical mill system as the pulverized coal preparation system, which is arranged at the cement kiln head or kiln tail to provide fuel for clinker calcination.

Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content
