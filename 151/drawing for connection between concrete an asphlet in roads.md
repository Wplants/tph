##  Asphalt vs Concrete Road Pavements and Some Significant Outstanding - JSIF
Concrete road surfaces are substantially more expensive than an asphalt solution, so we use concrete roads only where necessary. Concrete surfaces will normally last longer than asphalt surfaces but even after resurfacing of an asphalt road from time to time, it still makes far more economic sense to use an A/C surface rather than a concrete one.

## Concrete vs. Asphalt: What's the Best Roadway Surface?
Feb 16, 2021Concrete can be stamped and/or colored to increase safety at crosswalks or add to the overall attractiveness of a setting. Concrete road surfaces last longer - as much as 25 years, compared to 18 for asphalt. With proper care, both surfaces could last as long as 40 years, but concrete will require less maintenance.

Dec 29, 2021Concrete roads last for 20-40 years, while asphalt lasts for 10-20 years. But with proper maintenance, concrete roads can last for up to 50 years, while asphalt can last for up to 30 years. 4. Cost.

## Concrete Roads vs Asphalt Roads | Understanding the pros & cons
May 9, 2021The road surface offers better traction and skid resistance than concrete roads, thus making them safer in certain dynamic situations. Driving on asphalt roads generates less road noise and is much quieter than concrete roads. Higher heat absorption helps snow melt faster and moisture evaporate faster.

## Concrete Paving & Repair | McConnell & Associates
The primary difference between concrete and asphalt road surfaces is that concrete is a rigid structure and asphalt is flexible. The significance of this is in how the pavements react to traffic loads and the environment. Each has its specific advantages and uses. Concrete has a longer structural life. Typically, a concrete pavement is designed

## Joint Detail Where Asphalt Pavement Meets a Concrete Slab
A.: You won't be able to transfer load directly from a concrete slab to a flexible pavement. If you're stuck with an asphalt parking lot, the best approach is to pave a concrete apron around the building, with a slope that will ensure adequate drainage away from the building.

## Difference Between Asphalt vs Bitumen | NK Asphalt
The term bitumen is often mistakenly used to describe asphalt. A bitumen-sealed road has a layer of bitumen sprayed and then covered with an aggregate. This is then repeated to give a two-coat seal. Asphalt is produced in a plant that heats, dries and mixes aggregate, bitumen and sand into a composite mix. It is then applied through a paving

## Asphalt vs Concrete Roads - Duzzlag
Jul 1, 2022When it comes to asphalt vs concrete roads, one of the key considerations is the life span of each type of road. Asphalt roads have a shorter life span than concrete roads, typically 20-30 years compared to 30-40 years for concrete roads. However, asphalt roads are easier and less expensive to repair and maintain, so they may be a better option

## Can You Put Asphalt Over Concrete? - DC Construction
Unlike asphalt, concrete pavement has expansion joints. These joints are areas designed to allow the concrete to shift, in order to relieve any stresses on the surface in a stable way. It's important to note that, even with reinforcing measures, if you pave asphalt over concrete, the asphalt is likely to eventually crack at the joint areas.

## Asphalt vs. Concrete Road Construction - American Parking Control
Compared to asphalt, concrete is far more resistant to heat, so it may be the only realistic option in hot climates. Concrete pavement also offers a much longer lifespan than asphalt, and its manufacturing results in less pollution. While an asphalt road should last around 10 years, a concrete road can hold up for 40 years or more.
