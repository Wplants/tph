## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Jaw crushers are primary crushers used in an ore processing or mining plants. The size of these jaw crushers is determined by the square or rectangular opening from the feed opening (top of the jaws). For example, the 24 X 36 jaw crusher will have an opening of 24″ X 36″. while a 56 X 56 jaw crusher will have an opening of 56″ square.

## Introduction to Rock Crushers
Jaw crushers normally take the mined material and reduce it to a manageable size -say 10 to 4 inches. Cone crushers take the material from a jaw crusher and further reduce the material size. Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.
