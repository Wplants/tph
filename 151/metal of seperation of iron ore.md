Iron Ore Smelting Process. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being disposed of and the molten iron being poured into molds were it solidifies, now being in the form of pig iron

## What is the process of extracting metal from ore called?
It takes multiple steps to extract the "important" element from the ore: First, the ore must be separated from unwanted rocks. Then, the minerals need to be separated out of the ore. Since most minerals are not pure metals, further separation methods are required.

## How is Iron Extracted from Iron Ore | Actforlibraries
Iron is an element that has the chemical symbol, Fe. It is a metal that has been used since prehistory, by the Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians as early as 4000 B.C. These ancient peoples were able to get pure iron from meteorites that fell to the earth, and they used it in the tips of weapons and spears because of its strength and durability.

In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.24­0.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous

## seperation of iron from metal by magnetic seperation
An implementation of two-step concentration afterpurification allowed increasing the iron content in the concentrate up to 482 It forces to upgrade the process of dry magnetic separation or carry it out in the liquid phase so-called, wet separation Fig 5 shows the iron ore after the process of magnetic separation

## CONCENTRATION OF MINERALS - Electrical separation - Google
The electrical separation is used for: Separation of placer deposits of rare earth minerals. Separation of tin and tungsten ores. Separation of ferrous metals ores. Separation of non-metallic minerals: quartz, feldspar, coal, mica. Secondary metals: non-ferrous and ferrous metals, solid waste. Dedusting and dust collection.
