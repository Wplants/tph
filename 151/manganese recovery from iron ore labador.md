 In the oxide type manganese ore, the manganese is often present in the insoluble form of Mn 4+ and iron often exists in the state of Fe 3+. In order to obtain soluble Mn 2+,Mn 4+ must be converted into Mn 2+,therefore, reductants are applied to reduce Mn 4+ into Mn 2+ during the acid leaching process (Named as direct reduction leaching).

## Kami Iron Ore Project, Labrador, Canada - Mining Technology
The Kami open-pit iron ore mine is located to the south of Labrador City and Wabush in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Alderon Iron Ore acquired 100% interest in the Kamistiatusset iron ore property from Altius Minerals in December 2010 and is developing the project through its affiliate, Kami Mine Limited Partnership (Kami LP).

## Recovery of manganese from ferruginous manganese ore using ascorbic 
Traditional utilization of ferruginous manganese ore has mainly concentrated on the separation of Mn and Fe. However, an alternative process of novel uphill reaction diffusion followed by magnetic separation was developed for the synchronous recovery of manganese and iron as the form of ferrite ceramics from the ferruginous manganese ore in this work.
