## Advantages and Disadvantages of Reinforced Concrete
Reinforced concrete, as a fluid material, in the beginning, can be economically molded into a nearly limitless range of shapes. The maintenance cost of reinforced concrete is very low. In structures like footings, dams, piers etc. reinforced concrete is the most economical construction material.

## Reinforced Cement Concrete in Building Construction
Uses of Reinforced Cement Concrete. R.C.C is widely used construction material from foundations to the rooftops of the building. Some of its chief uses are listed below: • It is used as a structural element in beams, columns, footings, lintels, stairs, roofs and slabs. • It is used for pre-casting railway sleepers and electric poles.

Shrinkage in concrete can be controlled by using Type-K (Non-Shrinkage cement). Drying Shrinkage cracks are usually structurally not critical. They can be treated by preparing the cracks and injecting epoxy into the cracks to seal them. However, Plastic Shrinkage cracks can be more critical as these can penetrate to full depth of concrete.

## Reinforced Cement Concrete: Types, Advantages & Disadvantages
Disadvantages of reinforced cement concrete: The tensile strength of this concrete is 1/10 of its compressive strength. The price of this concrete used for casting is comparatively excessive. The RCC column section is larger than the metal section for multi-story construction. Due to the shrinkage, the crack increases and the strength decreases.

Reinforced concrete is used in the construction of almost all types of foundations such as piles and rafts. Reinforced concrete piles, both precast and cast-in-situ have been in used for foundations of structures of different types like bridges and buildings. Fig. 5: Reinforced Concrete Raft Foundation. 6.

## Fiber Reinforced Concrete Topic
Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is concrete made primarily of hydraulic cements, aggregates, and discrete reinforcing fibers. Fibers suitable for reinforcing concrete have been produced from steel, glass, and organic polymers (synthetic fibers). Naturally occurring asbestos fibers and vegetable fibers, such as sisal and jute, are also used for reinforcement.
