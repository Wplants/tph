## Nitric acid - Essential Chemical Industry
Some 99% acid is required for the manufacture of, for example, organic nitro-compounds for the explosives and dye industries. Nitric acid and water form an azeotropic mixture, with a maximum boiling point of 395 K, containing ca 68% nitric acid by mass; thus the concentrated acid cannot be obtained by distillation of the aqueous solution.

## What is Nitric Acid? - BYJUS
Nitric acid is a very strong acid, turns blue litmus red. Nitric acid decomposes on standing to form brown nitrogen dioxide. This is the reason why it becomes brownish over time though fresh nitric acid is colourless. 4HNO 3 → 4NO 2 + O 2 + 2H 2 O; Nitric acid liberates hydrogen gas with metals above hydrogen in the metal activity series.

Producing nitric acid: The Ostwald process. The Ostwald process is used to produce nitric acid from ammonia. Nitric acid can then be used in reactions that produce fertilizers. Ammonia is converted to nitric acid in a three-step process. Firstly ammonia is oxidised by heating it with oxygen, in the presence of a platinum ((text{Pt})) catalyst, to form nitrogen monoxide ((text{NO})) and

## Concentrated Nitric Acid 70% (68 - 70%) | LabAlley
Nitric Acid (70%) is a mineral acid with a suffocating smell and produces red fumes at room temperature. It is considered as the strongest acid due to its low pH and highly reducing nature, making it injurious to human health. Any chemical that meets the purity standards set by the ACS (American Chemical Society) is termed as the ACS grade reagent.
