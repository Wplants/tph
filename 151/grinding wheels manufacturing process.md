## Could Switching to Grinding Help My Manufacturing Process?
Oct 15, 2020One significant benefit to grinding is the compressive residual stresses that are imparted into the surface of the part during a machining process. If residual stresses are causing parts to twist, warp or bend after your machining process, grinding is an excellent way to remove material and relieve some of these stresses in the part.

## Grinding process and grinding wheels. - Manufacturing World
Apr 25, 2021Grinding is a process of removing material by the abrasive action of a revolving grinding wheel. Mostly the grinding process is considered to be finishing operation and very small amount of materials are removed from the surface of the work piece during the operation. Grinding Wheels: There are many abrasive tools like grinding stones, sticks
