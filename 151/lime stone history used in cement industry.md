For example, the carbonation resistance of concrete with a cement with only 15 mass % limestone was equal to that of a cement with 30 or even 50 mass % limestone when the w/c ratio was reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3 (Figure 3). Of course, sophisticated process measures in cement plants are necessary for the production of high-limestone cements.

## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as
