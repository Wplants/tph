The body acts as an expansion chamber and funnels the hot air and smoke into the flue. The fire pot sits immediately below and in front of the intake. This leaves the fire open on three sides. Sometimes the intake is a foot above the firepot. If this style is used be sure to close the gap between the forge and the hood/flue.

## Coal Forge Hood, Simple & Inexpensive | Shady Grove Blacksmith
Coal Forge Hood, Simple & Inexpensive. Inexpensive to build out of recycled material. Works as good as an expensive hood! This basic system allows for a reasonable sized pile of green coal on both the chimney side of the firepot and the opposite sides of the firepot leaving room for the coke trough down the middle of the firepot.

## Building a Super Sucker Side Draft Forge Hood - Alex Bealer
8. 9. 10. Author: Jim Guy. Submitted by: jguy Date: 06:44. If you've been to my shop, you probably remember my forge was equipped with an 8" chimney a Centaur Forge half-hood. This setup worked fine most of the time, but it did produce a bit of smoke at times and the shop did develop a fine covering of soot in places.
