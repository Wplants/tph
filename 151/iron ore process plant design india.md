Processed Iron Ore increases campaign life. Fine particles and Alumina in the feed end up as accretions in the kiln walls. Lower Alumina in the feed means a considerable reduction in cleaning and maintenance of the kilns. CDE Wet Screening technology also ensures lesser dust accumulation in the dust cleaning system reducing its cost implications.

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
