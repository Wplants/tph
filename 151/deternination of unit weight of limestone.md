Unit weight of a soil mass is the ratio of the total weight of soil to the total volume of soil. Unit Weight, g, is usually determined in the laboratory by measuring the weight and volume of a relatively undisturbed soil sample obtained from a brass ring.Measuring unit weight of soil in the field may consist of a sand cone test, rubber balloon or nuclear densiometer.

Let's say you are dealing with basalt, which is pretty common in New Jersey. According to this chart, solid basalt weighs 188 lbs. per cubic feet. So, taking 60 and multiplying it by 188, you get 11,280. In order to calculate tons, you will then take that and divide by 2,000. Using the above example, you have a boulder that is about 5.6 tons.

As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft.
