## Which type of coal use by cement industry. - Youth4work
8 Answers. Bituminous coals make the best coke and are in any case the most common, and these are most often used in the cement industry, although steam coals are occasionally used. When burning a pulverised fuel, higher volatiles are preferred because they speed up ignition and allow a coarser grind to be used.

A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement.

## Fire and Explosion Hazards in Cement Manufacturing Industries
For grinding, large cement plants use high speed roller mills or bowl type grinding mills, and smaller plants use tube mills packed with paper bags filled with iron grinding balls. Step #3: Kiln Burning & Cooling. Raw mix is transported hydraulically to an air separator. Here the mix is separated into coarse and fine particles.
