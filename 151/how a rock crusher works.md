## How How Rock Crushers Work - Panola Mining Machinery
How Does A Rock Crusher Work: The working principle of jaw rock crushers for sale is: when the stone crushing equipment works, motor drives belt and pulley to move, and the eccentric shaft drives the mobile jaw plate. When the mobile jaw plate rises, the angle between elbow plate and mobile jaw plate becomes larger

A rock crusher is a device used to crush rocks into smaller pieces, usually for gravel or some other road or building application. Most rock crushers have a hopper at the top -- a container which holds the rock above the crusher and uses gravity to feed it in. Alternately, rock crushers can use a belt drive to continuously transport the rock

The procedure works quite well for this type of crusher but tends to understate power requirements in fine crushers where power rates are typically much higher (upwards from 0.25 KWH/tonne). Because of this, a research program was instituted by Allis-Chalmers Comminution Task Force Committee to break rock in a manner more analogous to that
