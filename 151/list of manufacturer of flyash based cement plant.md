## Role of Additives in Optimization of Flyash in Cement - NBM&CW
The addition of superplasticizer in cement disperses the cement particles and allows the glassy content of the fly ash to react effectively with the lime liberated by the hydration of the cement to form CSH. The increase in flyash content from 29% to 35% in a cement plant of 5000 tons capacity per day, extra 462 tons flyash can be loaded.
