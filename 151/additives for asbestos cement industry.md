Mar 17, 2022The vast majority of harm caused by asbestos use in the United States was entirely preventable. As early as the first century, asbestos products were suspected to cause health problems, and as asbestos use grew throughout the twentieth century, the negative effects of asbestos exposure became more and more apparent.

Asbestos cement, genericized as fibro, fibrolite (short for "fibrous (or fibre) cement sheet") or AC sheet, is a building material in which asbestos fibres are used to reinforce thin rigid cement sheets..

One place where asbestos cement was widely used was on top of garage roofs as part of the roof sheeting. These will feature a similar surface patten to other asbestos products, but it may be hard to tell for certain, especially to the untrained eye. A tell tale sign for asbestos roofing is the wavy / corrugated design of the sheeting.

## Asbestos cement - RICS
Asbestos cement differs from AIB in that the material has a higher density and contains cement. This means that it is less likely to release asbestos fibres, and also has a greater capacity to repel water. As such, it is more suited to external applications but is not suitable as a fire-retardant board. Asbestos cement has been used extensively
