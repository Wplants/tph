Gold ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft. When mined with an iron pickaxe or better, it drops one gold ore. It serves little use in crafting tools because the resulting tools won't be very durable, a fact often overlooked by players. Gold ore is found deeper than many ores in the game, below layer 30. Its block ID is 14. Gold has some uses for crafting items. Gold ore is used to make

The treatment of copper-gold ores has been plagued by several problems because of the interaction of copper minerals with the cyanide leach solution and the dissolved gold cyanide. Apart from the higher consumption of cyanide caused by the dissolution of various reactive copper minerals such as azurite, malachite, chalcocite, cuprite and bornite, native copper also causes the loss of gold due

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.

River sand is becoming scarce and meeting the demand of fine aggregates in the construction industry is becoming a challenging task. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize gold ore tailings as a partial substitute for river sand in producing concrete. River sand is replaced with 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% gold ore tailings and the resulting fine aggregates were used in concrete mix
