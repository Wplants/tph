Defining Cation Exchange Capacity Cations held on the clay and organic matter particles in soils can be replaced by other cations; thus, they are exchangeable. For instance, potassium can be replaced by cations such as calcium or hydrogen, and vice versa.  Cation exchange capacity is usually measured in soil testing labs by one of two methods.

Cation exchange capacity ( CEC) is a measure of a soil's ability to hold exchangeable cations. It provides an indication of a soil's fertility and ability to resist acidification. CEC is an inherent soil characteristic and is difficult to alter significantly. Soils with a higher clay and organic matter content tend to have a higher CEC.

## Cation exchange capacity
Cation exchange capacity is the first characteristic you should consider when you get your soil test results. Cation exchange capacity (CEC for short) is closely tied to the amount of organic matter and clay you have in your soil since both provide spots for positively charged ions --- cations --- to cling to the soil.

## Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
The cations in the soil that concern us the most are calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and hydrogen (H). The capacity of the soil to hold and exchange cations is determined by the amount of clay and/or humus that is present. These two colloidal (negatively charged) substances are essentially the cation warehouse or reservoir of the soil.

Cation exchange capacity measures the ability of a soil to hold onto exchangeable cations. All soil is made of clay, silt, organic matter, and sand. The parts of soil made up of clay and organic matter have negatively charged sites, which attract positively charged ions, known as cations, and absorb them to pass onto plants.

Jan 16, 2022The key difference between cation exchange capacity and anion exchange capacity is that cation exchange capacity shows the quantity of negative charge available to attract cations, whereas anion exchange capacity shows the positive charge that is available to attract anions in a solution.. Resins are important substances in the field of analytical chemistry.

## Cation-exchange capacity
Cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is a measure of how many cations can be retained on soil particle surfaces. Negative charges on the surfaces of soil particles bind positively-charged atoms or molecules (cations), but allow these to exchange with other positively charged particles in the surrounding soil water. This is one of the ways that solid materials in soil alter the chemistry of the soil.

## Three-Dimensional Mapping of Clay and Cation Exchange Capacity of Sandy 
However, the soil is sandy and infertile, and they are difficult to improve agriculturally without information about clay and cation exchange capacity (CEC—cmol(+)/kg). In terms of clay, knowledge is important because it is an indication of the capacity of soil to hold moisture and potential to store exchangeable cations [2,3].

## Cation Exchange Capacity | ZeoliteMin
What are Cation Exchange and Cation Exchange Capacity? Soil clay minerals and organic matter tend to be negatively charged, thus attracting positively charged ions (cations) on their surfaces by electrostatic forces. As a result, the cations remain within the soil root zone and are not easily lost through leaching.  China Tel: +86 592
