## Placer Gold Mineral Processing - JXSC Mineral
About Placer Gold. Placer gold refers to the gold formed by the rock gold in the mountain washed by the river and separated from the quartz vein. Because this kind of gold is as fine as sand, it is called placer gold. Gold mining is divided into rock cave digging and panning in rivers and streams containing gold. For example, gold taken from mines is called gold or melon seed gold, and gold

1. Rock gold is the most common form of pure gold. Gold is hidden in the quartz veins in the rock, we need to find the gold-bearing rocks first, then exploit the ore, crush them into ore powder, and then purify them by gravity or flotation. 2. The placer gold is easy to mine. The process of rock gold mining is relatively complicated and difficult.

## What Is Placer Gold and Where Do You Find It?
Placer gold occurs when a larger lode deposit is worn away by flowing water. Small pieces of gold break away from the lode deposit and get carried off by the water. Placer deposits generally don't stray too far from their original site. However, some lucky prospectors have reported finding placer gold far from any known lode deposits.

A lone prospector with a gold pan can verify the existence of a placer gold deposit in a short period of time. Small placers are also relatively easy to mine, and the ore usually requires less processing than ore from lode mines. The same holds true for large placers other than drift mines. To-day, placer gold production comes from the dredge
