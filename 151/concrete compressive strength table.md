While traditional concrete normally has a compressive strength ranging anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 psi, UHPC can have a compressive strength of up to 10 times that of traditional concrete. After just 14 days of curing, UHPC has a compressive strength of 20,000 psi. This number increases to 30,000 psi when fully cured for 28 days.

## Is the compressive strength of concrete?pro
"In all cases, the 28 days compressive strength specified in Table-2 shall alone be the criterion for acceptance or rejection of concrete" The table-2 of IS : stipulates the specified characteristic compressive strength of 150mm cube at 28 days corresponding to a grade of concrete.

## Standards for 7-day and 28-day strength test results
A. According to section 19.2.1.3 of ACI 318-19 the specified compressive strength shall be based on the 28-day test results unless otherwise specified in the construction documents. 3- or 7-day test results are used to monitor early strength gain, especially when high early-strength concrete is used. However, 3- and 7-day test results are not

## Compressive Strength Of Concrete | What you need to know
Feb 19, 2022Concrete compressive strength for the general construction ranges from 22 N/mm2 to 25 N/mm2 or 15 MPa to 30 MPa or 2200 psi to 4400 psi, where it goes higher in industrial and commercial structures.  A table shows concrete compressive strength gain after one day, two days, seven days, 14 days, and 28 days considering the concrete grade you
