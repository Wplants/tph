## The Steel Manufacturing Process - How is Steel Made?
The EAF method is the most common steel production method today. Today's modern EAF steelmaking furnaces produce 150 tons of steel per melt, which takes approximately 90 minutes.. Custom Metal Manufacturing. Steel is a versatile, affordable and abundant material, making it the perfect substance to use in countless manufacturing capacities.

## Metal Melt & Pour: Life of a Casting | Reliance Foundry
A large EAF used in steel production can hold up to 400 tons. A "charge" of this steel is often made of heavy iron like slabs and beams, shredded scrap from cars and other recycling, and pig iron ingots from a smelter. After the tank is filled, electrodes are placed into the metal, and an arc of electricity passes between them.

Recycled steel (also called scrap steel) is one of the industry's most important raw materials. It comes from demolished structures and end of life vehicles and machinery as well as from the yield losses in the steelmaking process. Every steel plant is also a recycling plant, and all steel production uses scrap, up to 100% in the electric arc
