Specific gravities are expressed in decimal numbers, for example, 4.00 for corundum, 3.52 for diamond, and 2.72 for quartz. Zircon, one of the densest of all gemstones, may have a specific gravity as high as 4.73! Specific gravity is an important tool in gemstone identification that is useful for the gem buyer as well as the gemologist.
