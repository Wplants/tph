The more compact grained and heavier a stone the harder it is. Due to alternate wetting and drying the resulting crushing strength can be reduced even up to 30-40%. Being dry stones allow more crushing strength than when wet. It is the ability of a stone to endure and maintain its essential and distinctive characteristics i.e. resistance to decay, strength and

## Test on Aggregates, lab tests, fine aggregate test, coarse aggregate 
Aggregate Water Absorption Test. Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate. Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength, impact and hardness tests. Water absorption shall not be more than 2% per unit by weight.

Polished stone value (PSV) This is a most important test that an aggregate can undergo if it is to be used as a road surface course. If an aggregate polishes too much under the polishing effect of vehicle tyres, the road surface becomes very slippery, especially when wet, and the number of skidding accidents can increase.
