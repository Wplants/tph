Post-consumer electronic waste contains a large range of valuable elements that can potentially be recycled. An analysis by the UN e-waste coalition reports that 7% of the world's gold reserve may be contained in e-waste and there is 100x more gold in a tonne of smart phones compared to a tonne of gold ore, leading to increasing interest in 'urban mining' to recover and recycle it.

E-waste carries up to 10 times more excessive concentration of gold in comparison to gold ores. It approximately contains 10-10,000 g of gold/ton, whereas the gold ore contains barely 0.5-13.5 g of gold/ton. The rapid surge in e-waste generation is due to the increased usage of gadgets as well as their limited life span.
