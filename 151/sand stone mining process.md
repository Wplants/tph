Sandstone rocks are a type of rock found in the Desert Quarry south of Bandit Camp as well as the Necropolis mine in the Kharidian Desert.These areas are subject to desert heat, so players mining here need waterskins, the circlet of water, or the Desert amulet 4 to avoid taking damage.. Sandstone respawns quickly, so a player can mine continuously at a group of only three to four rocks.

## How is Granite Mined? Everything You Need to Know.
Mining granite is a very large industrial process. The first step of making a granite slab is to mine the raw granite materials out of the crust of the earth in large, heavy blocks. Granite slabs are attained from specific sites that are known as quarries. Normally, miners choose quarries that are as close to the surface of the earth as possible.
