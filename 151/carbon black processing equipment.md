Carbon black on the other hand is an engineered compound and is an essential ingredient in the production of tires and other rubber goods. It also is used as a pigment in printing inks, paints, and plastics. Carbon black is produced by pumping oil through a furnace, where it is heated above 2000°F. This process produces a carbon black fume.
