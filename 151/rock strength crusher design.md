Compressive Strength; Generally, bricks have high compressive strength in the range of 5.5 N / mm 2 to 140 N/mm 2.. If the crushing strength of the bricks is less than 3.5 N/mm 2 it must not be used. A field test about strength of the bricks is to fall the brick from a height of 1 meter and it must not break in to pieces.

## Evaluation of size reduction process for rock aggregates in cone crusher
The size reduction process of rocks in cone crushers is one of the most important issues, particularly for the secondary and tertiary stages of crushing operations. In this study, 17 different rock types were considered for the evaluation of their size reduction variations that occurred in a laboratory-scale cone crusher. Based on several mineralogical, physico-mechanical, and aggregate
