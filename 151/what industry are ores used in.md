## Metals Industry - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Nonferrous metal industry, i.e., copper, zinc, and lead produces a large amount of waste. Low metal content in the mined ore means that waste from the ore enrichment process constitutes 80%-90% of the total amount of processed material. The mining of these ores results in geomechanical, hydrological, and chemical transformations.

Ferrous slag is currently underutilized. Although the construction industry does use some slag as an aggregate, most is simply discarded. However, slag could be used to treat acid soils or acid mine drainage. Doing so would both offset the cost of restoring abandoned mine areas, as well as decrease steel manufacturers' current waste footprint.
