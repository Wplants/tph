## Classification of Bricks - Civil Engineers PK
The crushing strength of the brick should not be less than 10 N/mm2. This limit varies with different Government organisations around the country. Uses: First class bricks are recommended for pointing, exposed face work in masonry structures, flooring and reinforced brick work. b. Second Class Bricks:

## How do earthquakes affect buildings? | U.S. Geological Survey
Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage to man-made structures. Many factors influence the strength of earthquake shaking at a site including the earthquake's magnitude, the site's proximity to the fault, the local geology, and the soil type. More than 250 structures throughout the United States have been outfitted with seismic sensors by the USGS National Strong Motion

For centuries, buildings constructed of brick have withstood the ravages of hurricanes, tornadoes, high winds, hail, and punishing rain. When used in conjunction with modern building codes, brick homes can remain standing when others on the same block might be destroyed. Since 1891, Acme Brick has been manufacturing these almost indestructible building blocks.

## Which Masonry is Stronger, Brickwork or Blockwork?
Sep 11, 2020All concrete blocks are required to have a compressive strength of about 1900 pounds per square inch. However, many dense blocks are stronger than this. This is because the average concrete block can withstand 3500psi and the average brick should withstand about 3000psi. Other Factors to Consider When Choosing Between Brickwork and Blockwork
