## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which, about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400 o C (2500 o F), and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.
