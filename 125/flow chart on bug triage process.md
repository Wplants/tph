Apr 15, 2021By combining the bugs, you avoid unintentionally assigning the same problem to multiple people. If that turns out the bugs do not have the same underlying problem, you can separate the bugs after the fact. The main idea is to reduce the number of items you need to run through the complete bug triage process.

##  Bug Triage: An Automated Process - IRJET-International Research Journal 
Abstract - Bug triage means to transfer a new bug to expertise developer. The manual bug triage allocation process is opulent in time and poor in accuracy. There is a need to automatize the bug triage process. In order to automate the bug triage process, text classification techniques are applied using stopword removal and stemming.

## Triage Methods and Patient Flow Processes in Emergency Departments: A 
Conclusions This report uses the term triage in referring to systematic categorisation of emergency department (ED) patients according to their level of medical urgency, i.e., how quickly patients need to receive care based on their medical condition.. Flow processes refer to various means used to organise the work of processing patients in the ED, with the aim of speeding up patient throughput.
