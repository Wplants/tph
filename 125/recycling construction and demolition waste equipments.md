## CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION RECYCLING - Sparta Manufacturing
Sparta's roots are in designing, building, and installing C&D recycling systems of all sizes (from 100 to 2000 tons per day). Keeping in close contact with its C&D system customers throughout North America, the Sparta team has developed a deep understanding of their evolving processing goals, and how to design systems to effectively meet them, with flexibility to expand and further evolve.
