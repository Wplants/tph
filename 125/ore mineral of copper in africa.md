In North Africa reserves of iron ore are concentrated in the Atlas Mountains and in the western Sahara. Egypt, however, has medium-grade reserves, of which the most important are at Al-Baḥriyyah Oasis. The ore deposits in Morocco and Tunisia, which were once of considerable importance, have been severely depleted. Africa's most significant iron reserves are to be found in western and

## Africa: Minerals and Mining - Geography
MINING. Mining has a long history in Africa. In North Africa, people have mined for iron ores and other metals for more than 2,000 years. Iron mining began in sub-Saharan Africa by around 500 B.C. and had spread through the region by the A.D. 200s. Iron played a crucial role in the improvement of agricultural tools and weapons.

## Geology of Copper | Properties, Mining, and Formation of Copper
Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.
