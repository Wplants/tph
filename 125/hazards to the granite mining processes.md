## What is Strip Mining? - Definition from Safeopedia
Strip mining is a mineral-extraction process in which a layer or seam of undesired material (called "overburden") is removed from the surface of an area to allow efficient access to a desired material existing underneath the layer being stripped. As the process suggests, it is a form of surface mining, and it is primarily used to extract

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes. The leakage of chemicals from mining sites can also have detrimental effects on the health of the population living at or around the mining site.

## How is Granite Mined? Everything You Need to Know.
Granite slabs are attained from specific sites that are known as quarries. Normally, miners choose quarries that are as close to the surface of the earth as possible. The layers of earth above which the stones are formed are firstly removed to uncover the granite. After this, an open cast mining process is used to extract it from the earth.

How Granite is Mined and Imported. Granite is found close to the surface, meaning it can be cut from shallow quarries.
