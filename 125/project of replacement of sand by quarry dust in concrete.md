## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
1)- Workability - It is defined as the ease with which we can work with concrete. So when we use quarry sand in concrete, due to its heavy weight it reduces the workability of concrete. 2)- Mixing - Due to its heavy weight and large particles, it doesn't mix properly in concrete. 3)- Price- Price of quarry sand is lower than price of river sand. Availability of quarry sand is easy in compare than river sand especially in UP.

## Replacement Of Sand With Quarry Dust In Concrete Production
This paper features an experimental study on the replacement of sand with quarry dust and its influences on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The project is about replacing sand in concrete production with quarry dust at varying percentage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to check if the strength matches that of grade MIS with a mix ratio of I :2:4 and also the proportion which has the highest strength.

Recent research into the potential of quarry dust in cement mixes have focused upon a partial replacement of the sand. The results to far suggest that a cement mix made of quarry dust has an increased workability, making it more flexible and easy to use, but there are doubts about its durability, and compressive strength.
