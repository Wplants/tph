The use of gold and other minerals than the difference in flotation. The larger the difference in specific gravity, the easier to separate. The gold-bearing sands are placed into the cylinder sieve and flowed through the high-pressure water, and the gravel sands larger than the sieve holes are transported into the tailing field through the chute and belt; the sands smaller than the sieve holes

According to the degree of ore oxidation, gold ore can be divided into primary (sulfide ore) ore, partially oxidized (mixed) ore and oxidized ore. Here are the different kind of gold ore processing methods used for five types of gold ore . Poor sulfide gold ore processing. Polysulfide gold ore processing. Gold-bearing polymetallic ore processing.

Its major purpose is to perform the grinding and blending of rocks and ores to release any free-gold that is contained within them. At major mines, the mill was the critical equipment that was required to process the ores that were extracted from deep underground.

Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.
