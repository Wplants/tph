## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide, no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative. A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH.

Gold extracted by amalgamation or cyanidation contains a variety of impurities, including zinc, copper, silver, and iron. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more readily than gold does at temperatures equal to or

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

The ore must be ground to a specific size before it can be treated. But instead of being floated away from the rock, it is dissolved by the cyanide to form a liquid solution. As I mentioned for this process to work the ore is ground to a specific size, at a predetermined density. It is then put into a large holding area where the cyanide is added.

Nickel plating would involve using a nickel anode in an acid. The solution turns blue and becomes nickel acetate. When copper, brass, or steel are used as a cathode, they will be plated in nickel. However this process does not work to plate aluminum because the acid attacks the aluminum eating away the surface faster than the nickel can be.

For efficient stripping of gold, from activated carbon, reversing the above is logical. Thus successful elution should be favoured by high temperature, high free cyanide, high pH, low ionic strength and the absence of calcium. This is an excellent starting point to commence elution optimisation.
