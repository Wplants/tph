The key heavy minerals in these deposits include ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and leucoxene (mixture of altered titanium bearing minerals). In 1996, mining and processing of the heavy mineral sands began from the Old Hickory deposit. A second mine (Brink) was permitted about 19 miles to the south in Greensville County in 2008.

Titanium ore always involved in ilmenite and miners need to process the ilmenite to get high grade titanium materials in South Africa. Ilmenite nominally contains only 53% TiO2, so it must be purified before further processing. Raw ilmenite or slag ore is first soaked in sulfuric acid for several hours to free up the titanium from the mineral.

Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich

The process flow is: sulfuric acid decomposes titanium ore into TiOSO4. After purification and concentration, the titanium solution is hydrolyzed into TiO2•H2O. The hydrolyzed product is washed, filtered, and calcined before surface treatment, and separation and impurity removal work should be carried out in a timely manner.

## Titanium Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The further processing of titanium alloys is very similar to that of nickel-based superalloys. Billet converting, thermomechanical processing and machining are typically used to produce final components and have to be controlled tightly to guarantee good mechanical properties (Fig. 12.7).Although investment casting is possible for titanium alloys, the high affinity for oxygen limits this process.
