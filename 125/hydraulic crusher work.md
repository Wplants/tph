## What are Hydraulic Accumulators? How do They Work?
It is a simple hydraulic device which stores energy in the form of fluid pressure. This stored pressure may be suddenly or intermittently released as per the requirement. In the case of a hydraulic lift or hydraulic crane, a large amount of energy is required when the lift or crane is moving upward.

## How Does a Crusher Crush? - The Hydraulic Press | HowStuffWorks
How Does a Crusher Crush? Almost all modern car crushers use a hydraulic press to crush the cars. A large motor powers a pump that pushes hydraulic fluid to drive large cylinders. Using principles of force-multiplication, a hydraulic system can generate over 2,000 psi and impart more than 150 tons of crushing force onto a pile of scrap cars.

## How hydraulics can crush cars - How It Works
How hydraulics can crush cars. Hydraulics work on a simple principle: transferring force from one place to another using an incompressible fluid - often oil. A pump supplies oil at high pressure, which is fed to hydraulic cylinders and pistons. The fluid is not compressed, allowing most of the force to be transferred to the crushing plates.
