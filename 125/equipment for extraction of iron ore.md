## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Iron ore extraction. Iron does not occur in nature as a pure substance but as a compound in rocks, which can contain up to 50 % iron. These ferrous rocks are also called iron ores. The iron compounds contained therein are mainly iron oxides, but also iron carbonates or iron sulphides. The most important iron oxides include: magnetite: (Fe_3O_4)

C + O2 → CO2. The heat produced by this reaction is the main source of heat in the blast furnace that is used for iron production. At the bottom of the furnace, the temperature is very high, which causes more of the coke to react with carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide. C + CO2 → 2CO.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## How Does Mining Equipment Work in Iron Ore Mining?
The rollers and crushers will be the first to go, followed by the screening media and the reciprocating motors that power the vibratory screening decks. Top-tier mining equipment stops this scenario from becoming a system-handicapping reality. PREVENT IRON ORE ABRASION
