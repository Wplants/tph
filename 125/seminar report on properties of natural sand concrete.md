## What is M Sand? - 20 Properties, Advantages, Disadvantages
The bulk density of crushed sand is 1.75 gm/cm 3.; The specific gravity of crushed sand is 2.5 to 2.9 and it depends on the parent rock. While using Crushed sand in concrete there is no need to bulkage correction during mix design. The ability to old surface moisture of Crushed sand is up to 10%. It has less adulteration than the river sand It causes less damage to the environment as compared

## Properties of cement: physical and chemical Properties - Civil Knowledges
Properties of cement are two types physical and chemical. The ingredients of concrete can be classified into groups, namely active and inactive. The active group consists of cement and water, whereas the inactive group comprises fine coarse aggregates. Cement is a well-known building material and has occupied an indispensable place in

 The control over these physical properties of manufacturing sand make the concrete require less amount of water and provide higher workable concrete. The less use of water also helps in increasing the strength of concrete, less effort for mixing and placement of concrete, and thus increases productivity of construction activities at site.

1. Sea Sand. The particle size is too fine and too uniform for good class work. Sea sand used in its natural state causes corrosion to steel reinforcement due to the presence of salts. The higher percentage of salts also increase the setting time of the concrete, retards hardening, and may cause efflorescence.
