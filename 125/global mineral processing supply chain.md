## China and the Rare Earth Supply Chain Policy Brief - IER
The quota system is a response to China's problems with illegal rare earths mining [6]. Currently, six state-owned miners are in charge of China's rare earths mining industry and operate at the behest of the government. Mining is only one portion of the supply chain. China also dominates rare earth processing with at least 85 percent of

## Understanding Supply Chain Management in Mining Industry
Developing economies such as India and China are swiftly industrializing. With this growth come increased investments in infrastructure and heavy construction which in turn consume significant quantities of mining based commodities. For example, China accounted for more than 40% of global metal consumption in 2015, and its consumption of key base mining commodities is growing .
