## Methods of Stones Quarrying - Expert Civil
Following operations are involved in quarrying by blasting. Boring. Charging. Tamping. Firing. Boring: Blast holes of the required diameter and depth are made with a jumper. A little water is poured into the hole at intervals to soften the stone. The jumper is rotated each time it strikes the rock.

## Surface mineral workings: control of blasting
Blasting in hard rock quarries is needed to break up in-situ material which cannot feasibly be removed by mechanical equipment. The most important factors that determine whether blasting is necessary are the hardness of the rock and the type of machinery available for extraction.
