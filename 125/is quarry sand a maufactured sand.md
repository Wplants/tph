Many quarry operators have found that a processed high quality manufactured sand can improve their bottom line and significantly reduce the percentage of waste and low value by-products. Customer requirements for production below 20mm, especially for 7-10mm, mean that significant amounts of 0-7mm are produced as a by-product.
