## Green finance set to fund burning waste in cement kilns
4 minute read April 28, 2022. The cement industry, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, could soon be eligible to tap green financing markets to pay for waste to be burned as fuel in its kilns. While the industry is touting this as a way to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, environmentalists say it will discourage one of the world's

## Effect Of Coal Ash Characteristics On Kiln Performance And Clinker 
In coal fired kilns the ash characteristics (especially the ash fusion temperature) of coal ash thus could have a strong influence on the cement clinker phase formations. Compatibility of the ash fusion temperature and ash composition thus could influence the cement clinker phase morphology of the clinker minerals and their extent of formations

The amount of coal ash is the total of fly ash and clinker ash. The produced amount of Portland fly ash cement in specified by JIS R 5213 was only 46,000 ton in FY 2020, and the ratio of Portland fly ash cement to total amount of produced cements was only 0.09 percent. So, the coal ash is mainly used for a raw material of clinker in Japan.

In some localities natural gas or oil is cheaper, but 85.5 per cent of all cement kilns at present are fired with pulverized coal.

The selected coal oxide is much cheaper than 4A bran coal, so when put into production, it is still guaranteed to increase productivity and quality along with keeping the product cost. The solution of using coal oxide in the production of rotary kiln cement clinker has been applied by many cement factories many years ago.
