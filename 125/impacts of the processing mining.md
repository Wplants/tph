## The stages of mining: 5 lifecycle processes explained
Mining activities, including prospecting, exploration, construction, operation, maintenance, expansion, abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing of a mine can impact social and environmental systems in a range of positive and negative ways. Mining companies need to integrate environmental and social impact assessments into mining projects.

The major potential environmental impacts associated with mining and associated mineral processing operations are related to erosion-prone landscapes, soil and water quality, and air quality. These potential impacts are recognized and addressed in current mining operations as well as in some former mining operations by reclaiming areas of

## Energy and greenhouse gas impacts of mining and mineral processing 
This paper presents the results of these LCAs, with breakdown of the results to show the contributions of the various processing stages to the overall impact. Some possible technologies to reduce the energy and greenhouse gas impacts of mining and mineral processing operations are also described in the paper. Table 1.
