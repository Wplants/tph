## Solutions for Transitioning Coal-Dependent Communities - Headwaters 
The U.S. energy sector is transitioning away from the use of coal in power generation. Coal burned for power generation has declined by nearly 40% due to the closure of dozens of coal-fired power plants since 2010.. When coal mining and power generation operations cut back or retire, states and communities feel the pinch—especially when they have depended on coal-related tax and royalty

## Mountaintop mining in Appalachia: do the rewards justify the risks?
A form of surface mining, MTR uses explosives to remove the top of mountains so coal seams feet below the surface can be harvested. A dragline removes the coal and the debris is placed in nearby valleys. Excess water from processing, the coal sludge, is kept in impoundments; if a leak occurs environmental problems can result.
