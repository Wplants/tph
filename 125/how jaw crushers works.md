## how jaw crusher works
How Keestrack Jaw Crushers Work. A Jaw Crusher uses compression-based crushing to resize material, unlike an Impact Crusher which uses impacts to break up material. In a V configuration, the Jaw Crusher has one Fixed Jaw and one Moveable Jaw. The Moveable Jaw (also known as a Swing Jaw) pivots on an Eccentric Shaft at the top of the Jaw; this

## Everything about jaw crushers - what are they and how do they work 
Jaw Crushers are primarily used in the mining and ore processing plants where the workers need to crush massive rocks. The origin of jaw crushers goes back to 1858 when inventor Eli Whitey Black first introduced this piece of machinery. With the passage of time, the use of jaw crushers has not remained limited to the pit and quarry industries

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.
