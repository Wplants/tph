Jul 21, 2022Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding Know More. It appears, however, that the rate of ball and liner wear is greater in wet milling so the decision between wet and dry operation is, in cases where the choice is permitted, a matter of balancing the economic gain arising from reduced power demand and increased throughput against the increased cost of replacement of the ball charge and the mill .

Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

Abstract For dry ball mill grinding operation, the effect of ball and mill diameters on grinding rate parameters of the size-discretized population balance model has been investigated for quartz, limestone, a soft cement clinker and a hard cement clinker. Experiments were performed in three mills of 29.2, 40.6 and 61.0 cm diameter.
