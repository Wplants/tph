As a major rock-forming mineral or as placer deposits, quartz is abundant in nature, but resources of high purity levels are rare. Among the naturally-occurring ores, only crystal, vein quartz, metamorphic quartzite and pegmatite are high in purity, and can be ideal raw materials for HPQ products. China has more lean quartz deposits than rich ones.
