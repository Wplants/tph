Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. Gold and arsenic occur as a coupled substitution in the pyrite structure. In the Carlin, Nevada, gold deposit, arsenian pyrite contains up to 0.37 wt% in gold.  I bought 2 stacks of pyrite ore(89g per stack) and prosspected it..got 5

## Ask The Experts - How do I recover gold in pyrite? - ICMJ
The best answer as to how to recover that gold depends on the amount of pyrite you intend to process. If you have only a few pounds, it can be roasted by heat in the open air and then mixed with a flux like sodium borate and melted with a collector metal like copper. The melt can be poured into a mold and the gold will now be alloyed in the copper.

## Pyrite vs Gold - how to spot the difference
The first difference between pyrite and gold is the fact that pyrite isn't even a metal, it's a mineral. PYRITE — "a very common brass-yellow mineral, iron disulfide, FeS2, with a metallic luster". GOLD — "a precious yellow metallic element, highly malleable and ductile, and not subject to oxidation or corrosion. Symbol: Au".

Compared to real gold, pyrite is different in many ways. Fool's gold VS real gold. 1 Pyrite's specific gravity is smaller than gold. Gold ore weighs about 4 times as much as pyrite at the same volume size. 2 Pyrite is harder than real gold. Gold has a Mohs hardness of 3, while pyrite is 6, which is not easy to scratch.

## Trace elements in pyrite from five different gold ore  - figshare
Given this rise in popularity in pyrite trace element chemistry studies, a review of trace element incorporation in pyrite from various gold deposit classes is highly timely. We provide a global compilation of over 20 000 chemical data points resulting from over 5520 spot measurements of pyrites from five separate ore deposit classes, each of
