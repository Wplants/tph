## How is iron ore removed from the open pit mine? - Short-Question
How is iron ore removed from the open pit mine? The most common is 'open cut', where the overburden is removed with 'draglines', large 'electric shovels' and 'bucket wheel' excavators, after it has been drilled and blasted (Fig. 7.7). The overburden is usually loaded into large trucks and removed to a waste area in the mine.

Underground mining of natural iron ore deposits occurred on the Mesabi Range in northeastern Minnesota from 1892 to 1961. The Mesabi Range is the ledge rock exposure of the Biwabik Iron Formation, a geological feature that stretches in length for just over 100 miles, from west of Grand Rapids in Itasca County to east of Babbitt near the St. Louis / Lake County line.

Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.

Feb 17, 2021Open pit mining is widely used with metallic ore bodies (aluminum, bauxite, copper, iron), and nearly all nonmetallic (coal, uranium, phosphate, etc.). It is a traditional cone-shaped excavation (although it can be of any shape, depending on the size and shape of the ore body) that is used when the ore body is typically pipe-shaped, vein-type

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

Jul 25, 2022Strip mining is a surface technique where workers clear vegetation, waste rock, and overburden from the ground. Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface. Open-pit mining differs as workers excavate large landscapes on deeper slopes, separated by "benches."

## Geology and mining — MineFacts
The location of the deposit decides which type of mine can be set up. For example, an open pit mine cannot be started if the deposit is at a depth of 1,000 m. The quantity of ore extracted every year, the rate of extraction, differs between different types of mine. An open pit means that more ore can be extracted at a lower extraction cost.

Open pit and open cut mining are the least expensive techniques for the ore extraction. Overburden and stripping ratios are important in determining whether a deposit is to be mined. The stripping ratio describes the unit of overburden that must be removed for each unit of crude ore mined. A typical open pit iron ore mine is shown in Fig 1
