One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

## Industrial wastewater treatment: Mines and quarries
The principal waste-waters associated with mines and quarries are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads and also from rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites.

3. Processing Chemicals Pollution. This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies.

Chapter 4: Mining waste - SGU. CHAPTER 4: MINING WASTE. This chapter covers the different types of mining waste, how they are formed and how they are disposed of or used. Mining operations can generate enormous amounts of waste (i.e. waste rock and tailings) that must be managed and handled in a way that avoids negative environmental impact.
