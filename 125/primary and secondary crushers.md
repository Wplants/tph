In stone production line, primary crusher machine and secondary crusher machine are very important equipment, Generally, jaw crusher always used as primary crusher, cone crusher or impatc crusher used as secondary crusher. The two most common primary crushers used for coarse run-of-mine material is jaw crusher.The primary crushers break rock through compressive forces created by a hard moving surface forcing and squeezing the rocks towards a hard stationary surface.

The primary crusher receives material directly from run of mine (ROM) after blasting and produces the first reduction in size. The output of the primary crusher is fed to a secondary crusher, which further reduces the size of the material. Similarly the output of secondary crusher is fed to the tertiary crusher which reduces the material size further.
