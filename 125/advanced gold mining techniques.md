## The Advances of Technology & Methods of Future Mining Operations
Continued advances in mining technology have the potential to reduce the extraction period of a mine nearly in half. A mine given a 30 year lifespan, with the adaption to new mining technologies, could see the mine's lifespan decreased to 15 to 20 years. This makes investing millions of dollars into permanent infrastructure not as

Placer mining takes a variety of forms, including panning, "sluice-boxing", hydraulic mining, and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel. Some modern commercial placer operations are quite large and utilize heavy equipment and river diversions.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
