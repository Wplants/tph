Kaolin: processing, properties and applications. Sep 01, 1991Kaolin is one of the most versatile industrial materials. It is chemically in- ert over a relatively wide pH range, is white in color and has good covering power when used as a pigment or extender. Kaolin is soft and non-abrasive, and has a low conductivity of heat and electricity.

Kaolin is both dry and wetprocessed. The dry process is more simple and produces a lower quality product than the wet process. Dryprocessed kaolin is used mainly in the rubber industry, and to a lesser extent, for paper filling and to produce fiberglass and sanitary ware. Wetprocessed kaolin is used extensively in the paper manufacturing

Kaolin is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5 (OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO6) octahedra. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay.
