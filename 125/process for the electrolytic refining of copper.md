## How are metals refined by the electrolytic process - Tutorix
Electrolytic refining of copper: In an electrolytic tank, acidified copper sulphate (CuSO 4 + dilute H 2 SO 4) solution forms the electrolyte. A block of impure copper is made into an anode by connecting the positive terminal of a power supply (battery). A thin strip of highly pure copper metal is the cathode of the cell.

When copper is removed from the ore, it is around 99% pure or blisters copper. Using electrolytic refining, copper metals can be refined to 99.99% purity. The cathode (negative electrode) and anode (positive electrode) are both constructed of pure copper. As an electrolyte, copper sulfate is acidified using sulfuric acid in this procedure.

It is concentrated by froth-floatation process. Impure copper is purified by electrolytic refining. Impure metal is taken as anode whereas pure metal is taken as cathode.iSoluble salt of metal is taken as electrolyte. When electric current is ipassed, impure metal changes to ions which gain electrons at cathode iand change into pure metal.

## During the process of electrolytic refining of copper some metals 
During the process of electrolytic refining of copper, some metals present as impurity settle as 'anode mud'. These are (2005) RT2.303 0.059VF (2006) (a) - 8.12 (b) + 8.612(a) Fe and Ni (b) Ag and Au (c) Pb and Zn (d) Sn and Ag (c) - 37.83 (d) -16.13 23. Aluminium oxide may be electrolysed at 1000ºC to furnish aluminium metal (At.

Electrolytic refining:-Many metals, such as copper, zinc, tin, nickel, silver, gold etc. are refined by electrolysis. In this process, the impure metal is made the anode and a thin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. The solution of the metal salt is used as an electrolyte.
