## Operation Factors of Iron Ore Beneficiation Magnetic Separator
During the beneficiation stage, the raw iron ore has many monomer minerals and strong magnetic properties, which can appropriately increase the ore feeding speed. However, in the process of sweeping, the iron ore raw materials have more conjoined minerals and weaker magnetic properties, so the ore feeding speed can be reduced to improve the
