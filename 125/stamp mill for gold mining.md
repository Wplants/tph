When stamp mills are used for dry crushing, double discharge mortars are provided (see Fig. 50), and the screens are put low down, giving a small depth of discharge. These arrangements are necessitated by the difficulty of discharging the crushed ore from the mortar, the only means of doing this being the dashing of the dry ore against the screens, due to the fall of the stamps.
