Conclusions. Mineralogy and beneficiation of the Lamujärvi syenites were studied. In the sample, seven rare earth elements including La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Y were found with significant contents over 100 ppm and the total REE (TREE) is 4729 ppm. Meanwhile, the sample contains a high content of TiO 2.

Managing red mud (RM), a solid waste byproduct of the alumina recovery process, is a serious ecological and environmental issue. With ~150 million tons/year of RM being generated globally, nearly 4.6 billion tons of RM are presently stored in vast waste reserves. RM can be a valuable resource of metals, minor elements, and rare earth elements.

## Uranium from Rare Earths deposits - World Nuclear Association
A large amount of uranium is in rare earth deposits, and may be extracted as a by-product. Higher uranium prices and geopolitical developments would enhance the economic potential for recovering these. Rare earths are essential for many modern technologies. Growth in electric car use will depend, in part, on the availability of rare earths.
