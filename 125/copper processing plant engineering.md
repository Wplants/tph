## Copper Processing | Multotec
Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.

## Copper Processing: The Quest for Efficiency at Scale | E & MJ
Advances in copper processing technologies from the past 30 years nearly all fall into the category of "the bigger, the better" — higher volume flotation cells, massive high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGRs), super-sized concentrators. For some time now, we have been chasing economies of scale, which will soon cease to exist.
