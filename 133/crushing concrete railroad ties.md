## Railroad Tie - Types - Concrete - LiquiSearch
Concrete. Interest in concrete railroad ties increased after World War II following advances in the design, quality and production of pre-stressed concrete. Concrete ties were cheaper and easier to obtain than timber and better able to carry higher axle-weights and sustain higher speeds. Their greater weight ensures improved retention of track

## Concrete Crossties: New Railroad Design - Galesburg
This proposal is a hypothesis but with real possibility. RailTEC is known for designing and developing concrete crossties designs that work well for Armtrak. They are also known in developing designs for applications for heavy and light rail transit. Crossties are now being used and installed for field use and for testing.

## Why's That: The Surprising Sophistication of the Railroad Tie - WMUK
That's because rails wear out on curves and have to be replaced. Which means reattaching the rail to the ties - and too much reattaching can ruin a wood tie. Also, Franke said when all other things are equal, concrete ties generally last longer than wooden ones. Which means you don't have to replace them as often.

## Concrete Ties
On conventional wooden ties, there's a lot of "give" as axles roll over the rail. Ties compress and the rail dips a few inches depending on axle load. Concrete has none of that give. The "web" of the rail has to take the brunt of impact, of sudden loading and unloading. It tends to chrystalize the metal.

## Concrete ties
With concrete ties, the flexing of rails is extremely damaging, as concrete does not take well to flexing without developing fissures. These fissures permit water entry and the resultant rusting of the reinforcing steel bars within the ties. The rust expands and breaks more concrete. Also, the pumping ties erode the bottom surface of the

Used to indicate an emai action. When laying a path with pavers, you have a choice to fill the gaps with grout, ground cover plants, or filler stones such as gravel or decomposed granite. As a garden designer, I often advocate filler stones, which are permeable (and prevent rainwater runoff) as well as a design element to create a coherent look.
