## Ball Mills Or Vertical Roller Mills: Which Is Better For Cement Grinding?
Regarding operations, in a ball mill, the grinding media has a higher rate of wear about the rollers and table in the VRM. In ball mills, it is essential to monitor its performance via axial testing to ascertain that the media grading is right and that there are enough top-size media to grind the mill feed materials.

Higher density grinding media generally results in faster grinding in a ball mill. An optimum grinding charge for a ball mill may be experimentally determined, however generally the range is from 20% to 50% of the mill volume, or to the center line. Approximately 30-40% of the ball charge will be void space.
