Abstract. In this paper, the most important observations of the effect of seawater (SW) and/or sea-sand (SS) on the properties of concrete are presented and critically reviewed. Concrete is responsible for about 9% of global annual industrial water and almost 70% of the extracted natural sands use. During last decades many researchers focused

Clean your sandbox on a bright, sunny day, giving the sand a better opportunity to dry out. Clean play sand regularly to avoid bacteria. To prolong the cleanliness of the play sand in your sandbox, keep the sandbox tightly covered when not in use, and shift the sand once a week so that the sand on the bottom moves to the top.
