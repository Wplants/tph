##  Silica Sand Mining EIS Meeting.gov
Sand mining has occurred in Wisconsin for hundreds of years; however, recently there has been a dramatic increase in the number of mining proposals. This increase is attributed to a surge in hydrofracking, a technique used by the petroleum industry to extract natural gas and/or crude oil from rock formations, which requires a certain quality

## Uses of Silica - EzineArticles
Silica is used in thermal industries because it has got an important property of stabilization in context of electricity. The main reason behind this is that silica has got a very low thermal expansion. 6. A major use of silica is in the glass industry. It is the main substance used in the production of glasses also known as silicate glasses.

The specifications for each use vary, but silica resources for most uses are abundant. In almost all cases, silica mining uses open pit or dredging mining methods with standard mining equipment. Except for temporarily disturbing the immediate area while mining operations are active, sand and gravel mining usually has limited environmental impact.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
