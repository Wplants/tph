## robo sand and river sand comparisone
Sand. Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass..

## Polymeric Sand vs. Regular Sand: Which to Choose for Pavers?
First off, polymeric sand is designed to improve the interlocking capabilities of paving bricks, slabs, and stones. As such, when used correctly, it is more durable than regular sand. Keep in mind, however, that polymeric sand is only suitable for filling joints that are 1 inch in size or smaller.

For your kind information, plaster sand requires less amount of finer partical than 150 micron and have particle sizes below 2.36mm and if you are making sand face plaster coat includes 4.7mm below size. So the difference between sand - no difference in material properties but have difference in size of particles.

Moisture is trapped in between the particles which are good for concrete purposes. Concrete Strength. Higher concrete strength compared to river sand used for concreting. Lesser concrete compared to M Sand. Silt Content. Zero silt. Minimum permissible silt content is 3%. Anything more than 3% is harmful to the concrete durability.

## Polymeric Sand vs Regular Sand for Pavers - How to Hardscape
Studies have shown that a larger granule within the sand joints actually provides better strength to the system. Additionally, granules that are less round in shape tend to provide a better lock between them to prevent washout. That is why if you are opting for a "regular" sand for your pavers, it is best to find a jointing sand.

## What do you put between paver joints? 2022
No, you cannot use regular sand for paver joints. You need to use a special sand that is specifically made for paver joints. This type of sand is coarser and has a lower water content than ordinary sand. If you try to use regular sand in your joints, the water will evaporate from the joint and it will not hold together properly.

Added an answer on July 13, 2020 at 8:40 pm. Advantages of Robo sand or m sand are : No or near zero impurities. Controlled gradation of particles. Hence, no wastage. No over sized particles or shingles, stones and pebbles. Generally dry, so doesn't fiddle with the concrete mix proportions. Higher concrete compressive strength achieved.

## comparison of strength with robo sand and regular sand
robo sand vs natural sand gharexpert. The quality of the sand has more impact on the strength of the structure in spite of the quantity of the cement used 1) If there is more silt in coarse sand, the strength of cement mortar is reduced from 1 % to 30% 2) If you take best quality coarse sand, it will give maximum strength.

## What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Robo sand  - The 
Added an answer on July 13, 2020 at 8:40 pm. Advantages of Robo sand or m sand are : No or near zero impurities. Controlled gradation of particles. Hence, no wastage. No over sized particles or shingles, stones and pebbles. Generally dry, so doesn't fiddle with the concrete mix proportions. Higher concrete compressive strength achieved.
