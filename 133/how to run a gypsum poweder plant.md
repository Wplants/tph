## Does gypsum add calcium to soilcake
For example, if you live in the coastal region, you might need to add gypsum to your soil to minimize soil salt levels. However, if you have sandy soil in your lawn, it's advisable not to apply gypsum to prevent excess calcium accumulation. Moreover, in areas where sodium levels are low, adding gypsum can deny the soil the much-needed salt.
