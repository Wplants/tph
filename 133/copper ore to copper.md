Extraction of copper ore depends on more than just copper contents as I mention above. Chalcopyrite is the most common or major ore of copper, which makes it cheap and easily accessed. The mineral is more likely to have less impurities to exclude from the extraction process. These key points make it affordable and easy for copper extraction.

In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

## How To Smelt Copper Ore - Realonomics
Jan 25, 2022First the ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid. This trickles slowly down through the ore over a period of months dissolving copper to form a weak solution of copper sulphate. The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning). How do you smelt raw copper in Minecraft?

Copper Ore is the first ore to being mined, and is mined from Copper Veins. A mining pick and the Mining profession are required to mine. Copper Veins may be found in many starting areas where the typical creature level is between about 5 and 18. Mining Copper stops giving skillups at 100. The most common zones to have Copper Veins are: Elwynn Forest - High Dun Morogh - High Northwest Loch

## Copper Ore & Concentrate - Iqg Metal - Quba Group
Concentrates are made by crushing and then milling ore down to a particle size that permits copper to be released by flotation. Copper concentrations in concentrates from various places ranging from 24 percent to 36 percent. After that, the copper concentrates go through a final filtration and drying process to reduce the humidity to 8-9 percent.
