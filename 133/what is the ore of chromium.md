## Chromium: Occurrence, principles of extraction, Properties  - BrainKart
The extraction of chromium metal from chromite ore consists of the following steps. 1. Concentration. The crushed ore is concentrated by gravity separation method. 2. Conversion of the concentrated chromite ore into Na2CrO4. The concentrated ore is mixed with excess of Na2CO3 and a small amount of lime and roasted in a reverberatory furnace at

What is chromium found in? Chromium is naturally present in many whole foods, including brewer's yeast, certain kinds of meats, vegetables, potatoes and whole grains. Chromium enters the body mostly through diet since it's stored in soil and rocks that penetrate the crops we wind up eating, plus in smaller amounts in the water that we drink.

## Chromium | History, Uses, Facts, Physical & Chemical Characteristics
Occurrence. Chromium is the 13 th most abundant element in the Earth's crust [2]. Chromium is not present in free form.

Chromium in chromite ore is in the trivalent state; industrial processes also produce the elemental metal and hexavalent chromium. The health effects of chromium are primarily related to the valence state of the metal at the time of exposure. Trivalent (Cr[III]) and hexavalent (Cr[VI]) compounds are thought to be the most biologically significant.

## The most important commercial ore of chromium is chromite $( | Quizlet
The most important commercial ore of chromium is chromite (F e C r 2 O 4) (FeCr_2O_4) (F e C r 2 O 4 ). One of the steps in the process used to extract chromium from the ore is the reaction of chromite with coke (carbon) to produce ferrochrome (F e C r 2). (FeCr_2).

## what is the ore of chromium
The principle chromium ore, chromite, is heat resistant in the same way It is this property, along with its chemical stability, that makes chromium useful as a refractory material Refractory materials are used as insulation to line the inside of blast furnaces and crucibles used in metal manufacturing, especially in refining metals and making
