In warm natural light, Iron Ore can have slightly green undertones. This really appears outside in the sunlight on home exteriors. Since it's a soft, warm black, it can also sometimes read as slightly chocolatey brown. It also has charcoal or gray undertones - but in a warm toned way. In general, Iron Ore will look more charcoal in bright
