Take-up bearings are a type of mounted bearing primarily used for adjusting and maintaining conveyor belt tension. Take-up is the process of adjusting the length of the belt and chain to compensate for stretch, shrinkage, or wear, and to maintain proper tension. This is done with the assembly of the necessary structural and mechanical parts

1. INTRODUCTION. The design of belt conveyor systems has been one of the most common occurrences in the South African mining field for over one hundred years. Conveyors are seen on virtually all mining installations, and are the biggest problem for the plant maintenance engineer, being the cause of most plant shutdowns.
