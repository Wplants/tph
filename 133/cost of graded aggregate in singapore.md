## What Is Aggregate Cost? Definition and Related Aggregate Terms
Aggregate cost is a term used to describe the total amount of money a particular project or proposal will cost a company. This cost is especially important for companies to know when planning projects or deciding to launch a new product or service. There are several other types of aggregates used both in business and the economy, including

## Well-Graded Aggregates vs. Gap-Graded Aggregates - Command Alkon
June 11, 2012. Over the past decade a major "discussion" has arisen over the desirability of the use of well-graded aggregates (WGA) vs. gap-graded aggregates (GGA) in concrete. The discussion has centered on two areas: 1) the technical benefits of WGA vs. GGA and 2) the use of specifications to promote the use of WGA.

The "as-placed" compaction of open-graded aggregates varies depending many factors including drop height, volume of material, moisture content and particle shape.

jalgaon. Jun 15, 2019. #3. Graded aggregate means using different size of aggregates so as to have a uniform consistency in concrete. Different sizes of aggregate will fill the gap and achieve higher strength. If this property is achieved then your concrete is said to be plastic and it can be used for actual application.

Aggregate. "Aggregate" is a collective term for sand, gravel and crushed stone mineral materials in their natural or processed state (NSSGA 1991). In 2009, the U.S. produced nearly 2 billion tons of aggregate at a value of about $17.2 billion. Roads and highways constitute31 percent of the total sand, stone and gravel market (NSSGA 2010).

## Grading of Aggregates - The Construction Civil
In grading of aggregates, the voids in the mixed aggregate would be minimum when the sand is just sufficient to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate. Voids in the coarse aggregate are filled in by sand and voids in the sand are filled in by cement. Mix that occupies the least volume is the densest and will produce the best results.

For levelling screeds, the specified aggregate requirement is 0-4mm washed sharp sand, whereas for heavy duty screeds the specification is 6-10mm coarse aggregates, for achieving the best results. In fine concrete screeds, up to 25% of 0-4mm of the aggregate is replaced with a single sized aggregate in a range between 6 and 10mm.
