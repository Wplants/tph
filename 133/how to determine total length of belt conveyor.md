Belt Pull = Total Weight x frictional coefficient. Belt Pull = 280 lbs x 0.5. Belt Pull = 140 lbs. Then, convert this to required power. Required Power = Belt Pull x Belt Speed. Required Power = 140 lbs x 50 fpm = 7,000 ft-lbs/min. Convert that to a useful unit of measure. One horsepower (HP) equals 33,000 ft-lbs/min.

The sum of these belt sections forms the geometric belt length L i in the mounted state, whereby this length specification then refers to the inner surface of the belt: Li = 2 ⋅ l + bl + bs. Figure: Belt sections. First, the wrap angle is to be determined on the basis of the pulley diameter and the distance between the pulleys.

## How To Calculate Gear Ratio - HBReducer
In our example, dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30/20 = 1.5.We can also write this as 3/2 or 1.5 : 1, etc.; What this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn.

## how to determine total length of belt conveyor
The length of belt can be calculate by the following equation Open belt drive is shown in Figure 3. Figure3. Open Belt Drive L = π r 1 r 2 2x x r r 2 1 −2 2 Where r1 and r 2 =Radii of the larger and smaller pulleys x = Distance between the centers of two pulleys L =Total length of the belt.
