The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## how a jaw crusher works
The crushing mode of the jaw crusher is a curved extrusion type. Its main working part is two jaw plates, fixed jaw plate (fixed jaw) and movable jaw plate (movable jaw). The crushing space is formed by the jaws.  Jaw crushers typically use the principles of compression and friction to break materials down. They're extremely powerful

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers.
