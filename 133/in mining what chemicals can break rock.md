Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

Chapter 4 Mining Waste Sgu. Chemicals used in processing. The amount of chemical wastes originating from mining processes are much lower in volume compared to that of waste rock and tailings but can be of a high risk due to high toxicity. A common chemical used in gold extraction is cyanide. The cyanide dissolves the gold to an aqueous solution.

A metal (from Greek Î¼Î­ÏÎ±Î»Î»Î¿Î½ mÃ©tallon, "mine, quarry, metal") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well.

## What natural chemicals break down rocks, corals, or shells turning them 
Answer (1 of 2): The most important mechanism for breaking down rocks, corals and shells into sand is mechanical rather than chemical. In the marine environment waves grind pieces of material together and they are physically broken into smaller and smaller pieces. Similar effects occur in rivers.
