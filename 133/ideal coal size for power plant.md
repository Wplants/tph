## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel

The overall efficiency of steam power station is about 29%.It may be seen that overall efficiency is less than the thermal efficiency.This is expected since some losses (about 1%) occur in the alternator .The following relation exists among the various efficiencies. Overall efficiency = Thermal efficiency × Electrical efficiency.
