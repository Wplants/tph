Location: All real estate value depends on location. In case of mining the location is predetermined by nature. Also, unlike housing, quarry locations in relation to the m arkets determine how much transportation cost will have to be paid by the customer. Transportation costs can double the delivered price of stone within 20 miles from the quarry.
