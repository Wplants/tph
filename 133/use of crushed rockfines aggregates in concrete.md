## Pros and Cons of Crushed Concrete | What Is the Use of Crushed Concrete 
Jun 30, 2021Crushed Concrete driveways are significantly more cost effective than gravel, ordinary concrete, or asphalt driveways. With advantages such as affordability, durability, and the fact that crushed concrete will never break or require maintenance, crushed concrete is an excellent driveway material.

## use of crushed rockfines aggregates in concrete
Jul 01, 1996· If there is a reluctance to use crushed rock aggregates in concrete manufacturing, it is primarily based on this allowance of a higher dust content in crushed rock fines than that in the natural sand. Most of the crushed rock fine aggregate produced in N. Cyprus contains approximately 17 - 25% of dust.

Crushed concrete aggregates are pieces of old concrete buildings, roads, and other destroyed concrete structures that are crushed in a crushing machine. This crushed material is then washed clean, then broken up into smaller fragments. The fragments are added to other materials, including virgin concrete, to create recycled aggregate.
