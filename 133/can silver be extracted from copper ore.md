## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Silver: A native element, mineral, alloy, and byproduct - Geology
Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.

The Hunt method-calls for the direct treatment of the ore with a solution of potassium cyanide to which ammonium hydroxide has been added. The gold is thus extracted together with some copper, and the metals are recovered by electrolytic precipitation, the gold, silver and copper falling to the bottom of the vats as a sludge.

## Extraction of Copper and Zinc - Chemistry, Class 12  - Class Notes
Extraction of Copper. It is mainly extracted from copper pyrites (CuFeS 2). The sulphide ore is usually of very low grade and contains iron sulphide, gangue and smaller quantities of arsenic, antimony, selenium tellurium, silver, gold and platinum. The various steps involved in the extraction are:

In this particular ore, the metals are present in the oxidised form. Obtaining metals from this ore is much easier. For example, Haematite ore ( Iron) and Bauxite ore (Aluminium) Sulphide Ores - In this particular ore, the metals are present in the sulphide form. Since it is difficult to extract metals from this ore, they are usually converted to oxides with the process of
