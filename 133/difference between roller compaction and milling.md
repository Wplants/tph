A roller is a ride-on machine most commonly used during road construction to compact the various layers of materials needed to build a road. Rollers can be used for other types of compaction, such as trash compaction or compaction for parks and fields. While there are various types of rollers they are all generally defined by the build, they are the large, ride-on machine, not a handheld machine.

Come hail or shine, heat or extreme cold, recycled asphalt can take it. If you live in a place where you experience cold winters with loads of snow and ice, an asphalt surface is much better. It produces less formation of ice on the surface and also allows for snow to melt faster than on a gravel driveway or road.

The main difference between a plate compactor and a roller is that the plate compactor has a base plate that works by vibrating to flatten the surface out and make it more even and smoother. The plate compactor has a larger surface area which helps to get the work done more quickly and efficiently.
