## Small scale mining in Ghana - 5 reasons to start this business
Advantages of small scale mining business in Ghana: Creation of employment. With the current increase of unemployment cases in Ghana, small scale mining will really bridge the gap of unemployment by taking in skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labor. This would reduce the high poverty levels experienced in remote areas where the minerals are

Concentration of Gold Ores - a Key to Reducing Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining. Posted 3rd June 2012 by Kevin Telmer. In artisanal gold mining, mercury is essentially used to concentrate the gold. It does this by bonding with the gold to form a heavy amalgam that is then easily separated from the other minerals.

## Reducing Mercury Pollution from Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
