## Why do coal fired power stations need cooling towers - Featured Answer
Nov 11, 2020In a cooling tower, atmospheric air is used as the cooling medium. The huge volume of cooling water used in removing heat from the plant equipment, gains large amounts of heat energy that increases it's temperature. In order to conserve water as much as possible, it is cooled in the towers and recirculated back to the plant.

## Water for Power Plant Cooling | Union of Concerned Scientists
In the western US, wet-recirculating systems are predominant. Dry-cooling systems use air instead of water to cool the steam exiting a turbine. Dry-cooled systems use no water and can decrease total power plant water consumption by more than 90 percent. [2] The tradeoffs to these water savings are higher costs and lower efficiencies.
