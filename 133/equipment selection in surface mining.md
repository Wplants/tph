## Experimental study of coal flow characteristics under mining 
The occurrence and mining conditions of underground coal seams become more complex with increasing mining depth, making mining gas extraction more and more problematic (Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021a, b).Gas extraction efficiency directly depends on the coal seam permeability, which, in turn, is controlled by several internal factors (such as coal strength, stress loading-unloading

One of the challenging problems for surface mining operation optimization is choosing the optimal truck and loader fleet. We refer to this problem as the equipment selection problem (ESP). In this paper, we describe the ESP in the context of surface mining and discuss related problems and applications.

The selection of the mining method may also need to occur prior to the completion of desired geotechnical or ore value determinations. The Mining professional will need to continually debate if the information picture is complete enough for the design. In some cases the picture will only be more complete when mining has commenced.
