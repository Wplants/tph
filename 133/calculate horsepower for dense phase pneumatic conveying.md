This criterion eliminates the total pneumatic configuration for machines which are too large. The signal transfer distance, D = D1 + D2 is easily evaluated. • If D < 4m : all configurations are possible. • If D > 16m : only electro- pneumatic is suitable. • If 4m < D < 16m : the choice is made using Diagram A.

## Four Basic Details to Consider with Dense Phase Pneumatic Conveying 
Dense phase conveying utilizes a relatively low velocity motive gas, relying on a high pressure differential (either positive or negative) to move your bulk materials. Low velocity results in a gentle transfer, with materials moving with less wear and impact. This makes dense phase conveying ideal for most abrasive, fragile, friable, or even

## Answers to Eight Common Questions about Pneumatic Conveying
A pneumatic conveying system transfers powders, granules, and other dry bulk materials through an enclosed pipeline using a motive force, typically air. A pneumatic conveying system is classified by two main types, dense and dilute. A proposed pneumatic conveying system can be tested prior to purchase to ensure it will operate as expected once

## Pneumatic Conveying - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
There are two distinctly different flow modes in pneumatic conveying, dilute-phase and dense-phase. Dilute-phase is used widely in industry due to its simplicity in design and operation. However, high air velocities (e.g. 20 to 40 m s −1 ) have to be used in suspension flow, often resulting in problems such as high power consumption, product
