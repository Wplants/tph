All jaw crushers reduce large sized rocks, ore, or other material by a compression action. A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate.

## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Jaw crushers are primary crushers used in an ore processing or mining plants. The size of these jaw crushers is determined by the square or rectangular opening from the feed opening (top of the jaws). For example, the 24 X 36 jaw crusher will have an opening of 24″ X 36″. while a 56 X 56 jaw crusher will have an opening of 56″ square.

Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates.
