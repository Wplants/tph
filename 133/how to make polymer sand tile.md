## Polymer-sand tile: reviews, stowage technology
The polymer-sand tile, which is mostly only positive reviews, is made taking into account the specific requirements for sand, which should have a medium fractionality and purity. The material is washed and calcined at high temperatures. For the production of tiles, the method of hot pressing of a mixture based on polymer-sand composition is used.

Depending on the product to be produced, the polymer particles that have been melted must be mixed with sand and pigment materials in specified proportions. For example, for roof tiles this ratio is 29/70/1, for curbs and tiles 24/75/1. The mixture must be added to the sand polymer melt-former equipment. Its maximum capacity is 180 kg/h.

## The 6 Biggest Mistakes When Using Polymeric Sand
UNDER-WATERING causes the polymeric sand to simply form a "crust" on the top. If you only have a crust, you don't have a proper bond in the joints. Eventually, the crust will break away, eroding the joint. It also causes cracks and gaps, because the sand hasn't fully bonded the entire depth of the joint.
