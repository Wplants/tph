## How Underground Mining Works | HowStuffWorks
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines. Surface mines excavate from the top down, a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association, De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper -- uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet, or 2 kilometers.

##  Considerations for Underground Coal Mines That Operate Near
Mines in the late 1960' s were based on horizontal dril holes in the coal seam that were driled from a shaft sunk into a coal seam (Fields, H.H., et. aI, 1973). Several underground coal mines currently use horizontal in-seam techniques to extract CBM from locations inside the mine. A cross-panel horizontal hole system is shown in Figure 5.

## A Basic Introduction to Underground Mining
August 26, 2021. Underground mining usually involves the digging of subversive tunnels and rooms below ground surface. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining and can be dangerous. This kind of mining is only used in areas where quality ore, such as gold, are concentrated in thin veins and other remarkably rich deposits.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
