Flat Form of a Flight of Screw Conveyor Calculator  Auger Conveyor: It otherwise called as the screw conveyor is a mechanism which utilizes a helical screw blade called a "flighting" which move in a circle round an axis within the tube, to move liquid or granular materials. Most of the bulk handling industries rely on this screw conveyor.
