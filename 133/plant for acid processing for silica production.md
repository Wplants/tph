The grade of SiO2 in quartz sand decreases with the finer grain size of quartz sand, and the grade of impurity minerals is the opposite. This phenomenon is especially obvious in quartz sand containing a large number of clay minerals. Therefore, the quartz sand ore before the selection is carried out. Washing and de-slipping are very necessary.

##  Production of Silica from Rice husk
This paper addresses the production of silica from the rice husk. The Rice husk ash (RHA) is obtained by burning of rice husk in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 500, 600 and 7000C, which is bio-organic Silica (SiO 2) and has high pozzolanic activity. The temperature and the time duration for the combustion process are optimized.
