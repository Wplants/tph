Copper pouring means that the idle space on PCB is taken as the base level and then filled with solid copper. These copper areas are also called copper filling. The significance of copper pouring lies in reducing ground wire impedance, improving anti-interference ability, reducing voltage drop and improving power supply efficiency, and connecting with ground wire can also reduce Ring Road area.
