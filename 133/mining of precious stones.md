## How They Do It: Gemstone Mining - Gemporia
OPEN CAST MINING. Open cast or 'open pit' mining is a technique of extracting gemstones, such as Diamond and metal ores, like gold and silver, from the surface of the earth by digging downwards, eventually creating a pit. This method is used when the gems lie near the surface of the ground and the earth covering the gemstones is relatively thin.

## Minerals of the Vikings | Rock & Gem Magazine
While the Vikings did manufacture and use ceramics, they made greater use of soapstone. Soapstone, or steatite, is a metamorphic talc-schist rock consisting of 20% to 80% talc, or basic magnesium silicate. At Mohs 1.0, talc is the softest of all minerals; talc content determines the hardness of soapstone.
