##  What Is Coal Preparation?
What Is Coal Preparation? • Coal preparation is the removal of undesirable material from the Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal by employing separation processes which are able to differentiate between the physical and surface properties of the coal and the impurities. Through coal preparation, a uniform product is achieved.

## coal mining - Coal preparation | Britannica
Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.

The coal is loaded on to large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or direct to where it will be used. Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors.

## Coal preparation plant
The coal delivered from the mine that reports to the coal preparation plant is called run-of-mine, or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground

The Macquarie Coal Preparation Plant prepared coal from the West Wallsend Colliery in the Newcastle coal fields. Before coal washing stopped at the plant, the company needed to cap its tailings storage facility while it also continued to operate. The challenge was how to progressively cap a facility that was still receiving tailing deposits.

## Shoal Creek Mine - Global Energy Monitor
The coal is mined underground using both longwall and continuous mining operations. The preparation plant is a 2,000-ton per hour jig plant, capable of washing over 11 million raw tons of coal per year. The mine is up to 1,300 feet deep at places, and crosses beneath the main course of the Warrior River.

## Coal Mining and Processing - How Does It Work?
Processing the Coal Source: bloomberg. After coal comes out of the ground, it typically goes on a conveyor belt to a preparation plant that is located at the mining site. The plant cleans and processes coal to remove dirt, rock, ash, sulfur, and other unwanted materials, increasing the heating value of the coal.
