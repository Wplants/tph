## Working Principle of Washing Machine [July 2021]
The primary standards behind the working of a washing machine are the radial and centripetal powers, Where centrifugation stimulates the interaction of sedimentation of various thickness particles to clean the clothing in the clothes washer. The washing machine works in two essential cycles. These are the wash cycle and the flush cycle.

## The device of the washing machine: the basic details and a working 
How does the washing machine work? Probably, it will not be a mistake if we say that every person on earth knows about a washing machine. All use them, but not everyone knows about the principle of their work. The structure of the washing machine is a very important detail, because it is knowledge from how it is arranged to solve many problems.
