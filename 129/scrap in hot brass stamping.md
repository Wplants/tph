##  Metal Stamping and Scrap Handling
When metal stamping plants are fully op-erating, everything moves fast. Metal coils feed presses at throughputs of up to 100 parts per minute. After each punch, metal trim falls away through the die, collected as scrap for recycling or sale. But all that produc-tion can quickly come to a halt if scrap cannot be cleared away.

## Types of Metal Stamping - How It Works, Process, Uses, Types
Metal stamping involves the use of a wide array of processes and techniques such as punching, blanking, embossing, coining, bending, and flanging. Metal punching is a fabricating process that removes a scrap slug from the workpiece when the punch enters the punching die. Punched material is normally in sheets but rolled metals can be used as well.
