All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.
