## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low-grade ores and bleed streams
Concentrating the nickel ores usually takes place close to the mine site, and involves chemical and physical processes to crush the ore and separate the nickel-bearing and gangue minerals. Mining nickel directly is the obvious route to obtaining pure nickel, however, nickel can also be recovered as a byproduct of other metals.

## nickel | Definition, Properties, Symbol, Uses, & Facts
Nickel is ferromagnetic up to 358 °C, or 676 °F (its Curie point). The metal is uniquely resistant to the action of alkalies and is frequently used for containers for concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide. Nickel reacts slowly with strong acids under ordinary conditions to liberate hydrogen and form Ni 2+ ions.

In this study, segregation roasting and magnetic separation are used to extract nickel from a garnierite laterite ore. The garnierite laterite ore containing 0.72% Ni, 0.029% Co, 8.65% Fe, 29.66% MgO, and 37.86% SiO2 was collected in the Mojiang area of China. Garnierite was the Ni-bearing mineral; the other main minerals were potash feldspar, forsterite, tremolite, halloysite, quartz, and

## Nickel Ore Mining Process,Processing Nickel Ores,Nickel Process Serving 
The magnetic and the gravity separation is usually secondary dressing method. Flotation copper sulfide nickel ore: often used in the flotation of copper sulphide minerals collector and frother. Application Nickel ore beneficiation can be applied to process copper nickel ore accompanied by Pyrite and other gangue or nickel oxide ore.
