The Cornish Alps began to dominate the landscape as every ton of usable china clay that was mined brought with it five tonnes of waste. Railways and tramways were built to transport the material to the coast. By 1910, Cornwall was producing some fifty per cent of the world's china clay, something in the region of one million tonnes every year

## Kaolin Clay (China Clay) - Rio Clays
How rio deals with kaolin. Kaolin (also known as china clay) is a white, soft, plastic clay mainly composed of fine-grained plate-like particles. It is chemically inert, non-abrasive and has low heat and electricity conductivity. Plastic clays have a wide range of colours, but when fired, selected clays give results that are pure white.
