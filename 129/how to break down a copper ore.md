## Copper Facts: Chemical and Physical Properties - ThoughtCo
The modern name copper first came into use around 1530. Properties: Copper has a melting point of 1083.4 +/- 0.2°C, boiling point of 2567°C, specific gravity of 8.96 (20°C), with a valence of 1 or 2. Copper is reddish colored and takes a bright metallic luster. It is malleable, ductile, and a good conductor of electricity and heat.

Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.
