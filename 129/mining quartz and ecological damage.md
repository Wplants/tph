## What Are NFTs, And What is Their Environmental Impact?
A non-fungible token (NFT) is a proof of ownership of a piece of digital art. It was invented as a way to allow digital artists to assert the originality of their work, in a medium where replicates are easily produced. When an artist mints an NFT of their work, an entry into a digital ledger called a blockchain is created.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

## What are the environmental benefits or concerns about engineered stone 
Just because quartz is plentiful, though, doesn't mean that engineered stone is an environmentally sound choice. There are serious concerns about ecological damage to mining sites and petroleum use in mining and fabrication. Engineered stone countertops are made of about 96 percent quartz, combined with acrylic resins that are petroleum byproducts.
