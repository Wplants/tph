## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## Refining & Processing, What Is Refined Sugar? - The Sugar Association
Whether sugar comes from sugar beets or sugar cane, the purification process is similar for each plant, and the result is the same pure sucrose.One difference in processing between the two plants is that sugar beets are refined at a single facility, a sugar beet factory and sugar cane at two facilities: processing starts at a raw sugar factory and finishes at a sugar refinery.

The beneficiation process begins with milling, which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage, extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing, grinding, wet or dry concentration. The type of milling operable in a certain plant is chosen by capital investment and
