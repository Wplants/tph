After mining the rock, they mechanically grind the rock until it's almost sand-like. Then through chemical processes they extract the minerals that they want (gold, platinum, etc.). The issue now is that they are left with all this sandy material (which is called tailings). To dispose of the tailings, the sand is mixed with water to form a slurry.
