## Refractory gold ores: Challenges and opportunities for a key source of 
Mar 23, 2021Gold miners are facing a reserves crisis, and what is left in the ground is becoming more and more challenging to process.Refractory gold reserves, which require more sophisticated treatment methods in order to achieve oxide-ore recovery rates, correspond to 24 percent of current gold reserves and 22 percent of gold resources worldwide (Exhibit 1).

## The recovery of gold from refractory ores by the use of carbon-in 
Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Mines examined the recovery of gold by chlorination of refractory carbonaceous and sulfidic ores, comparing various treatment methods in which a ground ore pulp is contacted with chlorine gas and activated carbon is added to the pulp for a carbon-in-chlorine leach (CICL). The objective of this research was to demonstrate the basic feasibility of CICL technology.

## Getting a Handle on Refractory Ore May Determine Gold's Near Future
A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. A refractory ore generally contains sulphide minerals, organic carbon, or both, generally leading to a more complex

The extraction of gold from refractory gold ores (RGOs) without side reactions is an extremely promising endeavor. However, most RGOs contain large amounts of sulfide, such as pyrite. Thus, investigation of the influence of sulfide on the gold leaching process is important to maximize the utilization of RGOs.

## Gold Recovery 101 From Sepro's Gold Recovery Experts
Refractory Gold. Any ore that is not readily amenable to recovery by conventional cyanide leaching at a reasonable grind size can be considered refractory. The three primary factors that cause gold ores to be refractory are: • Physical encapsulation - Extremely fine (<10 µm) particles are locked within an impervious, unreactive mineral.

 Basically, refractory gold ores (gold recovery efficiency of <50% in average using direct cyanidation) are classified into sulfide, tellurium and carbon ores.
