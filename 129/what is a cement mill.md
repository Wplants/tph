## How is Cement Made? [2022] - Specifier Australia
The basic ingredients for making cement are limestone and clay. These raw materials are mixed with water and ground using milling equipment known as a ball mill to form a slurry. This slurry is then mixed with gypsum in a proportion of 1:0.5 to make the raw mix. The ball mill is a rotating drum containing steel balls.

## What is Cement and How it is Manufactured? - The Machine Design
A cement is a binding substance, used to bind other buildings or civil construction material like bricks, stones, gravels, tiles, etc. Cement can be set and hardened independently and can bind other building materials together. It is a very fine powder containing limestone, clay, silica, and alumina. Also contained with bauxite and iron oxide.

Where the alkali occurs in the cement can affect this, but to get a first approximation, we need to track the equivalent alkali content. If a change is noted in the mill certificate, air-entraining agent dosages may need adjustment. Above 0.60%, alkali changes of 0.1% can be significant.
