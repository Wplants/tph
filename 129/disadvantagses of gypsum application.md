No Shrinkage Cracks: Gypsum reaction produces less heat as compared to cement reaction with water. So there are fewer Shrinkage cracks in gypsum plaster as compared to traditional cement plaster; Quick Setting Time: Gypsum sets quickly (i.e., within 25-30 mins).

## Do I need to apply gypsum?
By applying gypsum (applications may need to be repeated) Gypsum dissolves slowly and changes the chemistry in two ways: It creates a salt solution in the soil which reduces the degree of dispersion. This is a short-term effect, which occurs as the gypsum dissolves; The calcium in the gypsum replaces sodium attached to clay minerals.
