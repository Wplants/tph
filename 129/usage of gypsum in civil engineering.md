The gypsum will alter the cement properties, and it will prevent the flash set resulted from the hydration of calcium aluminate. Also, it will produce a mix with good workability for a longer time. Adding gypsum should be limited to a certain level. The European code stipulates the dosage of SO3 to 3.5-4% of the cement mass.
