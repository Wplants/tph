How is coal pulverized in the ball mill? 1. How is coal pulverized in the ball mill? Explanation: The pulverization in ball mill takes place as a result of action between the balls and coal, as the cylinder they are put in is made to rotate. The cylinder is partly filled with various sized steel balls.

Coking coal is converted to coke by driving off impurities to leave almost pure carbon. The coking coal is crushed and washed. It is then 'purified' or 'carbonised' in a series of coke ovens, known as batteries, where the coking coal is heated to ºC in the absence of oxygen for 12-36 hours.
