How is coal pulverized in the ball mill? 1. How is coal pulverized in the ball mill? Explanation: The pulverization in ball mill takes place as a result of action between the balls and coal, as the cylinder they are put in is made to rotate. The cylinder is partly filled with various sized steel balls.
