This process working so long to make a huge iron ore deposit. This activity took place between 3.5 and 2.5 billion years ago. Over a period of a billion years, huge deposits of iron ores were laid at the bottom of the sea. Iron ores mined today in the South Africa, Australia, and United States, are part of the huge deposits laid down at that time.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
