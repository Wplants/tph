## Continuous reduction firing in the tunnel kiln - Brick and Tile 
1 Introduction. In heavy clay ceramics, the term "reduction" can be explained as the removal of oxygen from the clay material. Generally, the oxygen-richest iron oxide, haematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), is responsible for the intense red colouring of brick. If you break up the compound by removing oxygen, magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), an oxygen-poorer iron

##  Sponge Iron Production From Ore -coal Composite Pellets in Tunnel Kiln
In the year 1908 use of tunnel kiln started for iron oxide reduction. This process was invented by E.Sieurin as Hoganas process [3]. In 1954, more kilns came in operation in SWEDEN and USA. Presently it is more popular in China for sponge iron  a small ball mill to produce its powder of less than 150 microns for making pellets.
