## Quarry Dust Uses in a Construction Project
Quarry dust uses is not limited to highway projects, in construction projects that involves homes building, it is fast becoming popular too. Partial replacement of sand with quarry dust will make good concrete that is well desired in residential construction. The final product is strong bricks, slabs or tiles that are produced at lower cost

How Far Does Quarry Dust Travel? Research has shown that large dust particles (larger than 30µm) will be dispersed within 100m of the source. Intermediate sized particles (10-30µm) are likely to travel m. However smaller particles (less than 10µm) can travel much further from the source.

An attempt has been made to durability studies on green concrete compared with the natural sand concrete. It is found that the compressive, split tensile strength and durability studies of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 14 % more than the conventional concrete. The concrete resistance to sulphate attack was enhanced greatly.

Rock dust in the soils: The underlying processes. Prof. Manning's interest in rock dust goes beyond fertilizer. Rock dust is also an effective means of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it for long periods of time in the soil through a process called carbon sequestration. This occurs in two ways—weathering and carbonation.

## Disadvantages Of Quarry Dust In Concrete
An attempt has been made to durability studies on green concrete compared with the natural sand concrete by usage of quarry rock dust and marble sludge powder as hundred percent substitutes for natural sand in concrete Recent focus on climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on our environment has caused many to focus on CO2

## What is Stone Dust and Why Would You Get It? - Nimvo
Stone dust is a byproduct of crushing stone. Although it was originally a waste product, it is now used for agricultural and hardscaping purposes. Most commonly, stone dust is used for paving projects such as driveways, patios, and pathways. There are different types of stone dust available, in terms of both the stone from which it originates
