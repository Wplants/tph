## Clay and Gravel - The Mother Lode of Gold Prospecting, & gold panning 
Between the clay and bedrock the gravel is said to be extremely rich in placer gold. It would be assumed that the gold was laid down in gravel, some sedimentary event covered it, and eventually decomposed into a clay. Through the eons other gravel was deposited upon the clay, creating false bedrock.

## » The Science of Bedrock Gold
In the original pay-streak on Wade Creek, gold is found as deep as 1 1/2 feet into the bedrock. The origin of the gold is supposed to have been from the quartz stringers in the schists.

Nothing but the gold-bearing gravel is removed, and the galleries are generally allowed to fall in as the work advances. Generally, the pay will be at a depth of 2 to 5 feet. In places where the bed of modern streams is lower than the level of wash-dirt, horizontal drifts are the most economical.
