RT @Rnevin4Nevin: 4 of 4 We are not naive. Bauxite mining is important to the economy. But, it must be properly and transparently managed, in the interest of the people of Jamaica. We have no confidence in NEPA or @matthewsamuda and @AudleyShaw. We need implementation not jargon. @AndrewHolnessJM. 18 Sep 2022 10:54:44

## Who is bauxite formed?rsandscience
Is there bauxite in Jamaica? Bauxite is the ore from which aluminium is made. Jamaica contains some of the largest known deposits of bauxite in the world. The mining areas are located in the western and central parts of the island. After mining, most of the bauxite is carried to alumina plants where it is refined into alumina.

Mining. MINING. MINING AND MINING RESOURCES. Although there had been attempts for over a century to establish small-scale mining in Jamaica, the present well-established mineral industry of Jamaica only dates back to 1952 when the export of kiln dried metallurgical bauxite ore was started. This was shortly followed by the export of alumina.

## Why Is Bauxite Important - Realonomics
What makes bauxite special? It is a rock composed mainly of aluminum-bearing minerals. It forms when laterite soils are severely leached of silica and other soluble materials in a wet tropical or subtropical climate. Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum. Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been extracted from bauxite.
