## What You Should Know About Metallurgical Coal - ThoughtCo
Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke, the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. Coal is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock formed over millions of years as plants and other organic materials are buried and subjected to geological forces. Heat and pressure cause physical and chemical changes that

## Impact | MCPA
Metallurgical coal has a higher energy rate and low moisture content. It is placed in an oven and heated to roughly 2000Â°F in the absence of oxygen. As the oven is heated the coal begins to melt and its volatile matter (such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur) is removed. The product that remains is called coke, which is roughly 90% carbon

Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is a low sulfur, low ash, and low phosphorus grade of coal. It is used to produce high-grade coke, which is an important reactant for manufacturing of primary steel in the blast furnace process. Metallurgical coal can be easily distinguished from thermal coal due to its caking ability and carbon

Coking coal must also have low sulphur and phosphorous contents. Almost all metallurgical coal is used in coke ovens. The coking process consists of heating coking coal to around ÂºC in the absence of oxygen to drive off the volatile compounds (pyrolysis). This process results in a hard porous material - coke.
