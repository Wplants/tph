## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
The major producers of copper ore are Chile, USA and Australia, the vast majority of the ore coming from open pit mining. In open pit mining the layers of soil and vegetation seam are scooped away until the copper bearing ore is exposed. This is removed by blasting, the resulting ore collected and transported to the ore processing plant.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

## copper processing - Roasting, smelting, and converting
Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

## Copper-Lead-Zinc ores - Danafloat
Most often the copper minerals are floated after galena depression. Galena is depressed using sodium dichromate, sodium sulfite, polysaccharide (starch, dextrin) or even CMC. Addition rates of these depressants can be critical if any recirculating load is returned to the bulk rougher circuit. This flotation step is conducted at alkaline pH.

## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
4. Beneficiation of Copper Ore. The next step in processing is called beneficiation. This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form. 5. Smelting and Extraction. The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution. 6.
