## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

The cyanide solution strength is also important in leaching gold, with the typical range of solution being in the 0.02% -0.05% NaCN. The gold particle size has a tremendous effect on the time required for dissolution in a cyanide solution. Generally, the finer the gold, the quicker it will dissolve. A 45 micron particle of gold would dissolve

A gold extraction rate of 99% can be achieved at optimal conditions which are a low pH level of 1 - 2 as well as the presence of oxygen and iron as an oxidant. Other advantages to cyanide are a low sensitivity to base metals and sulfur containing calcines, as well as adequate recovery from preg-robbing ores.

The Dangers Of Cyanide In Gold Mining Peer Ledger. Gold mining can be extremely dangerous and one of the most harmful practices is the use of cyanide to extract the precious metal from the rock. fortunately, there are a range of innovators trying to eliminate this notorious poison from the mining process. since the mid1800s, cyanide has been considered a cheap and effective way to separate.

cyanide process. cyanide process or cyanidation, method for extracting gold from its ore. The ore is first finely ground and may be concentrated by flotation; if it contains certain impurities, it may be roasted. It is then mixed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide (or potassium or calcium cyanide) while air is bubbled through it.

Cyanidation is a method used in the extraction of gold from its ore. This extraction is done by converting the gold to a water-soluble form. The cyanidation process of gold extraction or the use of cyanide is the most common leaching process, used in the extraction of gold from its ores. Some countries do not approve of this method of gold

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.
