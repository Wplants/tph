This process is commonly called 'coalification'. Coal occurs as layers or seams, ranging in thickness from millimetres to many tens of metres. It is composed mostly of carbon (50-98 per cent), hydrogen (3-13 per cent) and oxygen, and smaller amounts of nitrogen, sulphur and other elements.  Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or

Wastewater is generated during the mining process from groundwater produced during coal extraction, from water used by operators for equipment cooling and dust control, and from precipitation entering mines.

In surface mining, the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction.

## Drift Mining, Mining Process, Mining Techniques, Gold, Zinc, Coal 
Drift mining is a process of accessing precious geological material, like coal, by cutting into the side of the earth, rather than tunneling directly downwards. Drift mines have flat entries into the coal seam from a hillside. Drift mines are different from slope mines, which have a tending opening from the surface to the coal vein.

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits.As well as drift mines, small scale shaft mining was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with

Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.
