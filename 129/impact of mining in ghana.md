## Impacts of Illegal Mining (Galamsey) on the Environment (Water and Soil 
Illegal mining (galamsey) is known to cause significant environmental pollution; the chemical used and the waste heaps are a source of long term contamination of soil and water bodies. The thrust of this study was to assess the impact of illegal mining operations on the soil and water bodies at four (4) selected communities (Esaase-Manhyia, Aboabo, Mpatuam and Tetrem) in Bontefufuo in the

## Galamsey In Ghana - The Good, The Bad And The Ugly - Modern Ghana
"Galamsey" local parlance used to describe small scale illegal mining in Ghana has been a national headache for Ghana since the 1970s and the reasons are not farfetched.

## Impacts of Surface Gold Mining on Land Use Systems in Western Ghana 
Land use conflicts are becoming increasingly apparent from local to global scales. Surface gold mining is an extreme source of such a conflict, but mining impacts on local livelihoods often remain unclear. Our goal here was to assess land cover change due to gold surface mining in Western Ghana, one of the world's leading gold mining regions, and to study how these changes affected land use

We are interested on the effect on the vicinity of mines because these areas might be exposed to both the negative effects of mining (e.g. population displacement, pollution and social conflict) and the positive ones (e.g. direct employment, linkages, investment in infrastructure). Ghana is one of the top 10 producers of gold in the world.

The mining sector offers a vast contribution to Ghana's economic development, which has been widely acknowledged (Hilson, 2009; Ghana Chamber of Mines, 2012). The Ghana Chamber of Mines reported that the mining sector directly contributed 38.3% of Ghana's total corporate tax earnings, 27.6% government revenue, 6% to the country's GDP in 2011, and more than 40% total foreign exchange earnings.

Within this context, we visited three mining sites in Ghana in April 2018, Newmont Ahafo, Gold-en Star in Bogoso, and AngloGoldAshanti in Tarkwa. All three sites are enormously important for mining in Ghana, particularly in terms of employment and revenue generation, and thus provide a potentially important vehicle for local development.

## The impact of Chinese involvement in small-scale gold mining in Ghana - IGC
Small-scale mining is a significant economic activity that contributes about 30% of Ghana's total gold output and provides livelihoods to a large number of people. In Ghana, the small-scale gold mining industry has been 'reserved for Ghanaians' by law, often using rudimentary means of extraction. The last decade has seen a large increase

## Causes and Effects of Coastal Sand Mining in Ghana
Its contribution to Ghana's industrial output has increased from 17.4 per cent in 1986 to 20.8 per cent in 1993. However, the process of sand mining has accelerated coastal environmental degradation to an alarming rate in many areas. As a result the government has been compelled to spend millions of dollars to combat sea erosion.
