## The Dusty Dangers of Concrete Cutting & Grinding
Concrete cutting and concrete grinding are very dusty jobs in the construction industry, both posing a serious health risk to masons. Masonry blocks, bricks, and concrete slabs contain concentrated amounts of crystalline silica. When these materials are dry-cut they release silica containing dust into the workers' breathing zone. Regular exposure to this hazardous dust can lead to the
