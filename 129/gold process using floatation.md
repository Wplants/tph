## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules. First, ore is ground into an extremely fine powder. The powdered ore is mixed with water to create a slurry, which is mixed with surfactants to increase the gold's hydrophobicity. This mixture is placed into a large tank filled with distilled water.

## Advantages Of Using Gravity Concentration For Gold Recovery
While froth flotation and cyanide leaching both play major roles in gold recovery, the benefits of using gravity concentrators cannot be understated. As a low-cost addition to any circuit, it helps optimize the recovery process and mitigates processing risks due to ore variability. Here are just a few advantages of adding gravity concentrators

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
