## 12 Environmental Effects of Coal Mining - Environment 911
Coal mining requires a large expanse of territory. When a mining operation moves in, it invades and destroys sizable ranges of wilderness area, displacing the native fauna and removing habitat and food sources. This eventually results in an imbalanced ecosystem -- and even the endangerment or extinction of entire species. #10 Sink Holes

The development of mine entries disturbs the original stress distribution and at greater depths concentrates a high stress in the rock surrounding the entries and in the coal pillars. Geology - high stresses associated with deep cover can create a variety of unstable ground conditions.

Dec 10, 2020· Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.

## Experimental study of coal flow characteristics under mining 
The occurrence and mining conditions of underground coal seams become more complex with increasing mining depth, making mining gas extraction more and more problematic (Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021a, b).Gas extraction efficiency directly depends on the coal seam permeability, which, in turn, is controlled by several internal factors (such as coal strength, stress loading-unloading

## Commonly used mining techniques to extract coal - ICSC
As mining of coal depends on the depth and quality of the coal seams, different techniques are used to dig the deposits. Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction.
