## Type 1 Crushed Concrete | Primary Aggregates | Delivery or Collection
In the construction industry, most materials are measured in cubic yards. The same applies to crushed concrete. Rather than guesstimate how much crushed concrete you may require, the best way to work it out is by multiplying the length (in feet), by the width (in feet), by the height (in feet) and then dividing it by 27.
