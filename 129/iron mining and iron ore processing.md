## Iron Ore - Mining Artifacts
Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel. 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel. Minnesota's iron ore was actually discovered while prospectors were searching for gold. Since the object of their search was gold, the iron was ignored. It turned out the iron would become

## Iron Ore Mining Process Explained - Gordon van Veelen
Iron Ore Mining Process Explained. Necessary for the initial stages of the mining process, a miner's tools were generally constructed of iron with wooden handles and included a shovel, pike, hoe, pick, hammer and wedge. The ore reaped by these tools then needed to be hauled to the surface through a variety of means. Get Price.
