## Nature, genesis and industrial properties of the kaolin from Masirah 
A high plasticity and its light colour after firing indicate that this material is suitable for industrial use, especially in pottery. Occasional high contents of up to ∼25% extremely fine-grained quartz (sheet-like, <50 nm thick) reduce the need for quartz addition during the processing for ceramic materials; such natural kaolinite-quartz

## Kaolin Processing For Industrial Use
Designing A Process Of Kaolin Bleaching In An Oxalic Acid. Kaolin has many industrial uses, especially in the manufacture of paper, ceramics and porcelain. The commercial value of this raw material largely depends on its brightness. However, owing to the natural impurities primarily iron oxides, much of the kaolin is not applicable for industrial uses.
