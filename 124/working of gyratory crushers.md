## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
The optimum speed of gyration and the large eccentric throw produce two important results: 1) the rapidly closing head catches the falling feed material and delivers the extremely high crushing force and 2) on the other side of the chamber the rapidly receding head allows material to fall freely to the next point of impact or exit the chamber.

## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Jaw Crushers; Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).

Crusher Working Principle The primary gyratory crusher breaks the material by feeding mouth into the two rollers between the extrusion crushing, finished materials naturally fall. In case of too hard or can not be broken, the roller crusher by hydraulic cylinder or the role of the spring can automatically retreat.

The crushing process of the gyratory crusher is to rotate one circle along the annular crushing cavity, and it can work continuously at 360°, while the main shaft of the jaw crusher rotates only 135° once, so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is that of a jaw crusher. 2-3 times as high as the production efficiency.

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates, or rotates, within a concave bowl. As the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration, it creates compressive force, which fractures the rock. The gyratory crusher is mainly used in rock that is abrasive and/or has high compressive strength.

## working of gyratory crusher
In some cases, installation of a tertiary crusher is required where the maximum reduction is about 10:1. The secondary crushers are also designed on the principle of gyratory crushing, but the construction details vary. Similar to jaw crushers, the mechanism of size reduction in gyratory crushers is primarily by the compressive action of two

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.
