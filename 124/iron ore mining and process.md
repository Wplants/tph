## Fortescue plans $6.2bn investment to eliminate iron ore emissions
Australian iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) is planning to invest $6.2bn to phase out the use of fossil fuels from its iron ore operations by the end of this decade.. As part of its decarbonisation strategy, the firm aims to reach real zero terrestrial emissions (Scope 1 and 2) across its iron ore operations and intends to deliver carbon-free products to its customers.

## Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron
Iron Mining Process. From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces.  The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism

This means that the mined iron ores need to be specially processed in advance before the blast furnace process. Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China

## Process Of Iron Mining
The Mining Process. 1. Mining open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.
