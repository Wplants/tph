Disadvantages of fly ash: A few hours after pouring it changes from liquid to solid but the curing process may take longer. It can prolong the time as concrete takes more time to set. It reduces the amount of air ingress, and high concrete admixture, often requires more air-entraining penetration. The colour of concrete is more difficult to
