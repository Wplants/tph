The second stage is materials handling, which involves transporting the ore and waste from the mine to the mill or disposal area. The third stage, beneficiation and processing, occurs at the processing plant.

Environmental Impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite. Pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulphuric acid and dissolved iron, and as water washes through mines, this compound forms a dilute acid, which

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Mine development. Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. In open-pit coal mining, a pit is dug in an area and this pit becomes the open-pit mine, sometimes called a quarry. Open-pit mines can expand to huge dimensions, until the coal deposit has been mined or the cost of transporting becomes too great.
