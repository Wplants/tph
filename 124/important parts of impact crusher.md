## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
Impact crushing equipment: impact crusher (horizontal shaft) and vertical shaft impact crusher (vertical shaft). For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone.

## How to repair the wearing parts of the impact crusher
The impact crusher bears a very important secondary crushing production task both in the stone production line and in the sand production line. The production process is directly into the impact crusher after a crushing, and the hammer is driven by the motor. The liner is subjected to impact crushing production, and the wearing parts of the counter crusher are the hammer and the liner.

## AsphaltPro MagazineThe Benefits of Cubical Aggregate | AsphaltPro 
Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.
