## What are the main methods of mining? - American Geosciences Institute
PDF version. There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river

Open stoping. This type of mining is used to recover steeply dipping orebodies in competent rock. The ore is removed from the stope as soon as it is mined. Sublevel stoping and big-hole stoping are the important variants in use today. A few examples of commodities mined by this method include iron and lead/zinc. 8.3.1: Room and Pillar Method.

## Mining Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
MINING METHODS. The method of extracting the ore is dependent upon the nature of the ore occurrence. Each orebody is a problem in itself. All influencing factors, as size, shape, position, nature and grade of an orebody, and character of the enclosing walls, are fully considered before the method of extraction is decided.

There are three commonly used mineral processing methods: flotation, magnetic separation and gravity separation. Flotation. Flotation is a mineral processing method which uses the different physical and chemical properties of mineral surface to separate minerals. Foam flotation is widely used in industry.

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.
