The ancient alien astronaut theory presupposes that thousands of years ago even before recorded history our planet was visited by astronauts from another world, intelligent beings with technology beyond our own today.  According to Sitchin, the clay tablets describe an alien race known as the Anunnaki, who came to Earth to mine gold.

## Is Gold Mining More Energy Intensive Than Bitcoin Mining?
Bitcoin Mining vs Gold Mining.  Bitcoin can be more flexible in terms of efficiency than gold because it can be mined anywhere in theory, so miners could go to the locations where they enjoy the best energy efficiency. Nevertheless, a look at the efficiency issue from a macro perspective, makes gold a clear winner in terms of efficiency

## Sodium Thiosulphate Gold Leaching - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Few people realise that the gold mining industry only accounts for 13 per cent of total world cyanide consumption, and despite the widespread use and handling of cyanide in gold processing, the North American industry has recorded only three deaths attributed to cyanide over a period of 100 years (McNulty, 2001). What is remembered, are the 14

## The enclave hypothesis and Dutch disease effect: A critical appraisal 
Gold mining output and the real exchange rate are weakly exogenous variables in the system, with no feedback effects from gold mining to the real exchange rate. The impulse response analysis in Fig. 6(c) is consistent with the long-run causality tests. The figure illustrates that the impulse responses of the real exchange rate with respect to a
