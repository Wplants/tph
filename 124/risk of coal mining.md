## West Virginia Coal Mining Hazardous to Mine Workers' Health-Safety
Coal Miner Occupational Risk. Coal mine safety is highly regulated by federal and state governments. Nevertheless, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that coal miners are still more at risk of work-related injury, disease or death than are other workers in private industry. Many workplace dangers exist such as dusty air, underground mine

## Coal Mining: Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities Fact Sheet
Coal mining is a relatively dangerous industry. Employees in coal mining are more likely to be killed or to incur a non-fatal injury or illness, and their injuries are more likely to be severe than workers in private industry as a whole, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Coal mining is part of the Mining sector along with other mining and extractive industries such as oil and gas.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Coal mining, the first step in the dirty lifecycle of coal, causes deforestation and releases toxic amounts of minerals and heavy metals into the soil and water.  There is an increased risk of chemical contamination of ground water when minerals in upturned earth seep into the water table, and watersheds are destroyed when disfigured land

## Mining Hazards During Winter | Safety Services Company
Every year, mining fatalities rise during the winter season. The risk of getting ill, injured or killed is doubled, if not tripled, with the combination of low humidity, low barometric pressures and seasonal drying of some areas in coal mines. During winter, coal dust is suspended in the atmosphere what with the air being dryer than usual.

The worst miner casualty was near Monongah, West Virginia. The mine had an explosion that killed 360 miners. The most common disease in coal miners is known as black lung. The cause is inhaling coal dust which can be fatal, and it is easy to catch. Coal mining has proven to not only cause health problems to humans but also phycological illnesses.

Background Coal is produced across 25 states and provides 42% of US energy. With production expected to increase 7.6% by 2035, proximate populations remain at risk of exposure to carcinogenic coal products such as silica dust and organic compounds. It is unclear if population exposure is associated with increased risk, or even which cancers have been studied in this regard.

Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

During, the nonfatal lost-time injury rate for mining is 4.5 injuries per 100 FTE in coal mining and 2.9 in metal/nonmetal mining. This contrasts to a rate of 2.6 (2003 rate) for all industry. The higher rate in coal mining leads us to place greater emphasis on research for injury reduction in this Mining sector.

Coal mine reclamation is the rehabilitation of land after coal mining operations have stopped. It is a requirement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977..

Coal is abundant and inexpensive. Assuming that current rates of usage and production do not change, estimates of reserves indicate that enough coal remains to last more than 200 years. There are, however, a variety of problems associated with the use of coal. Mining operations are hazardous. Each year hundreds of coal miners lose their lives or are seriously injured.

In addition to carbon monoxide and heavy metals like mercury the use of coal releases sulfur dioxide a harmful substance linked to acid rain.

2. Fires. One of the most devastating calamities that could happen in a coal mine is a fire or an explosion. The fires can be caused by short-circuits in the electrical equipment or mechanical faults in the machines used. Since coal is already a very combustible material, the effects of a fire inside the mine will be especially devastating.
