## Moving the Coal Through a Coal-Fired Power Plant - Advancing Mining
Every year 1.1 billion tons of coal are burned in the U.S., with 90% of that being used for electricity generation. Several years ago, a University of Illinois professor reported that to produce 109 kWh/year of power, a plant burns 14,000 tons of coal every day. He noted that the coal that goes to a typical coal-fired power plant is crushed to approximately 5 cm in size before it is loaded

Coal ash is the waste that is left after coal is combusted (burned).

Coal = $2,934/kW. But that's with just 40 hours of energy storage (at full power). You'd probably need 2000 to 4000 hours of storage and 8x over build of wind farms to manage seasonal variations in wind power.
