Lime concrete is composite mixture of lime as binding material, sand as fine aggregate and gravel as coarse aggregate in appropriate proportions. Lime concrete mix ratio depends on the type of construction, but in general, it can be taken up to 1:2 ratio for lime, sand respectively and up to 1:3 ratio for lime, coarse aggregate respectively.

When any of these chemical products are added to concrete, it can create a desirable slump despite the lower-cement ratio. These admixtures are also used to gain specific concrete strength with the use of much lower cement content.
