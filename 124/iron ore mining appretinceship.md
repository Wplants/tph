## Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron - Metalliferous 
Iron is the most magnetic of the tree. The mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) is a naturally occurring metallic mineral that is occasionally found in sufficient quantities to be an ore of iron. The principle ores of iron are Henatite, (70% Iron) and Mgnetite, (72 % Iron). Taconite is a low-grade iron ore, containing up to 30% Magnetite and Hematite.

## Livelihood impacts of iron ore mining-induced land change in Sierra 
This study was conducted in the iron ore mining region of Tonkolili, located in northeastern Sierra Leone, West Africa ().The study area, hereafter referred to as Tonkolili iron ore region (TIOR) is 1614 km 2 situated between Tonkolili and Koinadugu districts. It is positioned between 8° 42' 45'' to 9° 14' 28'' north latitude and 11° 26' 8'' to 11° 50' 34'' west longitude.

Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.
