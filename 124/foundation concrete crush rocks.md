## The Pros and Cons of a Crushed Concrete Driveway - TRUEGRID Pavers
Unstabilized, loose crushed concrete has all the downsides that loose gravel does. It spreads and thins easily, requiring you to add more and to constantly even out your driveway so it doesn't develop bare spots and ruts. Crushed concrete also creates dust rather easily, which can stick to your vehicles and dirty them.

## The Differences Between Cement, Concrete, and Mortar
A structural building material used to make walls and slabs. Much stronger than mortar. Made from a mixture of Portland cement, water, and aggregate of various sizes. Available in several different formulations. Concrete is a complete building material used for foundation walls, concrete slabs, patios, and many other masonry structures.

Slab-on-grade foundation. As the name suggests, a slab is a single layer of concrete, several inches thick. The slab is poured thicker at the edges, to form an integral footing; reinforcing rods strengthen the thickened edge. The slab normally rests on a bed of crushed gravel to improve drainage.

## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.

Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.

## Shed Pier Foundation - The Advantages - Secrets of shed building
A shed pier foundation is not strictly a permanent foundation it comprises of a series of concrete blocks laid directly on the ground (occasionally a shallow hole is dug and filled with crushed stone), the tops the blocks are then levelled to support the main floor beams of the shed. The Advantages of Pier Foundations Are Many:

## Crushed Stone vs. Pea Gravel: What's the Difference? - Ozinga
Crushed stone is available in a variety of sizes, from 3/8" to 4". Because it is literally crushed stone, there is no consistency to its shape. The edges tend to be sharper and it feels rougher to the touch than pea gravel. Also, most crushed stone will either be in a white or gray hue, giving you a more neutral look than the colorful pea

## Gravel vs Concrete Shed Base | Which Is a Better Choice? - Site Prep
A gravel base acts like a sponge by wicking away the water that would normally collect around the bottom of the shed. A concrete base, on the other hand, cannot absorb water. This can create more water runoff issues during heavy rain falls. Additionally, the bottom of the shed also won't dry out as quickly with concrete.

Drainage. A gravel shed foundation provides much better drainage than concrete. A concrete floor can't absorb or drain water unless you also install a floor drain.This adds cost and a lot of extra work to the foundation. Excavation would have to be done to pipe the drain to a curb or drainage area.
