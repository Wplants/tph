## Understanding violence in artisanal small-scale mining
Central to the growth of gold production is Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM). The ASM sector eclipsed gold output from large-scale miners in 2017 and 2018, a trend which is likely to continue judging by last year's results. Latest gold delivery data from Fidelity Printers and Refiners (FPR) show that, in 2019, ASM accounted for 63

CONTEXT. Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining occurs in approximately 80 countries worldwide. There are approximately 100 million artisanal miners globally. Artisanal and small-scale production supply accounts for 80% of global sapphire, 20% of gold mining and up to 20% of diamond mining. It is widespread in developing countries in Africa, Asia

At a time in Nigeria between 1903 and 1940, ASM operations dominated the mining in Nigeria and up till now, there is still a substantial dominance of Artisanal and Small Mining. Artisanal and Small-scale mining accounts for over 90% of solid mining in the country. In Nigeria some of the mining products mined in the ASM include precious metals, gold and varieties of gemstones like Sapphire
