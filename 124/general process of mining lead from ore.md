## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
First the lead ore is ground into small particles that are less than 0.1mm, giving the ore a texture similar to table salt. Next the lead powder is put through a flotation process, that involves mixing the lead ore with water, the addition of pine oil and the introduction of air bubbles and agitation which forms an oil froth, containing the lead ore, on the surface.

The mining itself was accomplished by drilling into the face, inserting dynamite into the drill holes, blasting the face, and then shoveling the ore freed from the wall into a bucket to be sent up to the surface. Drilling was almost always accomplished through the use of an air powered piston drill operated by two men, a driller and a helper.

Lead was the first metal mined in Australia at Glen Osmond in South Australia in 1841, after the wheel of a cart being pulled up a rough track accidentally exposed some lead-zinc ore. In 1876, lead-silver ore was discovered and mined at Thackaringa, near Broken Hill in New South Wales, but the mines closed in 1877. Partially eroded lead

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

Treatment of lead and zinc ores begins with milling. Milling is a multi-stage crushing and grinding operation. It involves coarse crushing followed by wet grinding. Crushing is usually a dry operation that utilizes water sprays to control dust. Primary crushing is often performed at the mine site, followed by additional crushing at the mill.

Drift mining process: This process is carried out when the material is situated sideways of a mountain. The materials are easier to access and the mouth is made slightly lower than the resource area so as to allow gravity to pull down the materials easily. Generally, coal or iron ore is mined through this process. Shaft process:

## Lead - Essential Chemical Industry
The ore has first to be separated from clays and other silicates ('gangue') after which the lead ore and the zinc ore are separated. The process used is froth flotation, a succession of stages each delivering a greater concentration of the lead ore. The ore, containing gangue (which typically contains 3-8% lead) is ground with water to a
