## Calculation of Cement and Sand Quantity for Plastering - Online CivilForum
Step-1:Calculate the dry volume of cement and sand mixture required. Volume of plaster = Area X Thickness = 10 sq.m. X 0.012 = 0.12 cu.m. The wet volume of the mixture is always less than the dry volume. Dry volume of motor required for plastering = 1.27 X Dry volume of plaster = 1.27 X 0.012 = 0.1524 cu.m.

Plaster generally ratio used in construction = 1: 6 (1 part of cement and 6 part of sand). Roof plaster ratio use = 1: 4. Thickness of plaster is between =12 mm - 15 mm. For Better understanding please see below . Example . Suppose plaster area is 200 square metre ( Length 20m and wide 10) Ratio of plaster 1: 4 and the thick plaster is 13 mmm.

## HOW TO: Estimate Plaster Quantity for your CHB Wall
Based on the specified kind of mixture and plaster thickness, multiply your area with the corresponding values from the plaster proportion table: Quantity of Cement Bags = Area  Cement multiplier for a Class "B" mix. = 6m 2  0.192. = 1.152 bags ~ 2 bags. Quantity of Sand = Area  Sand multiplier for a Class "B" mix. = 6m 2  0.016.

If prone to environment, in this case mix of cement sand ratio 1:4 (1 part cement & 4 part sand) is used for plastering, others mix of cement sand ratio 1:5 and 1:3 are also used depends on different condition like size particle of sand, plain or rough face of brick wall, ceiling, environment condition and concrete wall as beam & column.
