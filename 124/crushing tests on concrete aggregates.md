The strength of aggregate is determined by the Crushing Value Test on aggregates. The aggregates passing through a 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on a 10 mm IS sieve are taken. These aggregates are subjected to gradual loading of 40 tonnes with the help of a plunger. The crushed aggregates are then passed through a 2.36 mm sieve.

## crushing tests on concrete aggregates
Recycling of Concrete Recycling Coarse Aggregate . Crushing value test The crushing value test was carried out by compression testing machine CTM . The total load of 40 tones was applied at the rate of 4 ton per minute. The percentage crushing value was determined by divided the passing weight from total weight of aggregate.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test Method - Project Management 123
Crushing Value Test Procedure, Select clean and dry aggregate passing through 12.5 mm and retained on 10.0 mm sieve. Weight the empty cylindrical measure. Let the weight be 'a' grams. Fill the aggregate in the cylindrical measure in three layers, tamping each layer 25 times with the rounded end of the tamping rod.
