## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

The iron plate is a material that can be made by smelting iron ore in a furnace. It is a component or subcomponent of almost every item in Factorio, and it is recommended to create a large stockpile when possible. When smelted in a furnace for a second time, iron plates will transform into steel plates, with a ratio of 5 iron plates per 1 steel plate.

Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.
