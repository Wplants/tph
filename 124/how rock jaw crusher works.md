## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher reduces large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. A fixed jaw, mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary breaking surface, while the movable jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the stationary plate.

The width of the jaw determines capacity. Jaw crusher output gradation is controlled by the closed side setting. This is the adjustable opening at the bottom of the jaw. With a 24" top size limit and an 8:1 reduction ration, the closed side setting should be no smaller than 3". A well designed jaw should be 80 to 85 percent efficient.

## Jaw Crusher Manufacturers In China - FTM Machinery
How does a jaw crusher work? When the jaw crusher is working, the movable jaws periodically reciprocate the jaws, moving up and down. When approaching, the material is crushed by crushing, splitting, and impact between the two jaws. When leaving, the broken material is discharged from the discharge port by gravity.

## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Rock crusher Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.

## Crusher
A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.
