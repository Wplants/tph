Uniaxial compressive creep tests were conducted on the concrete for a duration of 360 d.

## Prediction Models for Estimating Compressive Strength of Concrete Made 
The depletion of natural resources of river sand and its availability issues as a construction material compelled the researchers to use manufactured sand. This study investigates the compressive strength of concrete made of manufactured sand as a partial replacement of normal sand. The prediction model, i.e., gene expression programming (GEP), was used to estimate the compressive strength of

With the use of 100 percent manufactured sand, the strength of concrete can increase by up to 7.5 percent. Due to less surface area and better grading of m sand improve the workability of concrete. The flexural strength of the concrete also can be increased by using m sand. Because manufactured sand is processed from a selected grade of granite.

The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.
