## Belt conveyor calculation online
Tension Control in Conveyors Belt tension is a critical component in conveyor design. It limits the amount of load that a conveyor can carry and is important in transferring the power from the driving force into the belt via friction. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg [2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hgmm

Belt Pull = Total Weight x frictional coefficient. Belt Pull = 280 lbs x 0.5. Belt Pull = 140 lbs. Then, convert this to required power. Required Power = Belt Pull x Belt Speed. Required Power = 140 lbs x 50 fpm = 7,000 ft-lbs/min. Convert that to a useful unit of measure. One horsepower (HP) equals 33,000 ft-lbs/min.

Typical Conveyor Capacity. 1 in = 25.4 mm. 1 ft3/h = 0.028 m3/h. 1 ft/min = 5.08 x 10-3 m/s. The product cross sectional area is defined by the idler trough shape and the product pile on top of the idler trough the trapezoid shape. This section on top of the trapezoid can be described with a circle and the angle this circle makes with the belt
