Dolomite was the first fertilizer used to prevent hypomagnesemia (Cunningham, 1936).When applied at rates between 100 and 540 kg Mg/ha the Mg concentration of temperate forage is increased by 0.2-1.2 g/kg DM (Table 9.13).These increases in Mg concentration in the forage were associated with a rise in the level of exchangeable Mg in the soil (Jones, 1963b; Simpson, 1964).

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Dolomite is used as a source of magnesia (MgO), a feed additive for livestock, a sintering agent and flux in metal processing, and as an ingredient in the production of glass, bricks, and ceramics. Dolomite serves as the host rock for many lead, zinc, and copper deposits. These deposits form when hot, acidic hydrothermal solutions move upward from depth through a fracture system that encounters a dolomitic rock unit.
