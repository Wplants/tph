## Jaw Crusher Toggle Plates vs. Hydraulic Toggle Relief Systems
A toggle plate basically operates like a fuse. If any material enters a jaw crusher that cannot be crushed, whether due to its size or composition, the toggle plate is meant to break, relaxing the moving jaw open to allow for the uncrushable material to fall through or be removed manually. Traditionally, jaw crusher toggle plates are made of

## Jaw crusher maintenance : Pit & Quarry
Keep the toggle area clean, particularly before any crusher adjustments. It's best to wash out the toggle seats and plates daily, as wet material buildup results in a gritty compound that grinds down components, causing premature wear. Also, remove dirt and debris from crusher frame surfaces and from areas around the machine.
