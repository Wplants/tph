## introduction to types of mechanical milling
The type of milling machine most commonly found in student shops is a vertical spindle machine with a swiveling head. Although there are several other types of milling machines, this document will focus only on the vertical milling machine. A milling machine removes metal by rotating a multi-toothed cutter that is fed into the moving workpiece.

## Mechanical Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mechanical milling is the simplest top-down manufacturing technique that can be performed with or without a solid state chemical reaction. In simple mechanical milling,  Various types of milling media can be used, including zirconia balls (ZrO 2), metallic balls, and glass balls. Continued milling produces two-dimensional silver flakes.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## introduction to types of mechanical milling
Types of Milling Cutters Used in Machining Process. Milling is a cutting process where we use a cutter to remove the material from the surface of a metal or work piece. This cutter which we use has multiple rotating cutting surfaces. Milling cutters play an important role in the milling process and they are used in several milling machines.

So if we don't use lubricating oil in machine, then the life span of machine will greatly reduced, the more the friction will occur and the more decrease.
