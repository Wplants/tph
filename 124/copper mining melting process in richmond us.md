Figure 4.4 shows the schematic of the melting process. During the process, polymer pellets are melted to form a viscous liquid. The nanoparticles are then blended into the liquid polymer by a high shear mixer or in an extruder. The final bulk nanocomposite samples can be obtained by using injection molding, compression molding or extrusion.

Acids are introduced to copper-bearing ore, seeping through and dissolving copper and any other metals, including radionuclides. The liquid that "leaches" through the rocks is collected. This liquid contains the dissolved copper, known as a pregnant leach solution (PLS). The copper present in this liquid is collected and later processed.

Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

Metal recycling is the process of separating, cleaning, and melting ferrous and non-ferrous scrap to be used again as a raw material for new products. Metal is a material that can be recycled over and over again without degradation of its properties. Besides the ecological benefit of metal recycling, there is also an economic benefit.
