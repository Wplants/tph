## How Are Compounds Made From Carbon Unique - Realonomics
What makes carbon such a unique compound? What makes carbon unique is its ability in forming covalent bonds which are very strong in nature. The small size of the carbon atom makes the compounds of Carbon exceptionally stable. Hence carbon as an element has the ability to form a variety of stable compounds which can exist freely in nature.

## Class 10 Carbon and its Compounds Notes - BrainIgniter
Why do carbon not form ionic compounds by gaining or loosing electrons ? Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell. So, If it gains four electrons forming C 4-anion, it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons.; If it loses four electrons forming C 4+ cation, it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon

## Carbon compounds
There is a rich variety of carbon chemistry that does not fall within the realm of organic chemistry and is thus called inorganic carbon chemistry.. Carbon-oxygen compounds. There are many oxides of carbon (), of which the most common are carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Other less known oxides include carbon suboxide (C 3 O 2) and mellitic anhydride (C 12 O 9).

Carbon and its Compounds G10. What if we tell you that black coal and a shiny diamond has a fundamental similarity? Yes, you heard us right. Both black coal and the diamond are made up of carbon. The diamond and coal appear different because of the chemical bonding between their carbon atoms. Carbon can form a special kind of bond with other
