Jun 17, 2021Currently, a number of disadvantages hampers the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). The current review proves that concretes made with complete replacement of natural aggregate with RCA allow the production of high-quality concrete. One of the possibilities for improving concrete properties with RCA is the use of extended curing and pozzolanic materials with varying cement ratios. The

## What is Recycled Aggregate Concrete?
Uses of Recycled Aggregate: - Building the base of a road. The underlying layer forms a structural foundation for paving. - Ready mix concrete. This is a mix of water, sand and cement. It can substitute for the brand-new aggregate. This includes uses for walkways, residential streets and concrete paving. - Stabilizing the soil.

The use of recycled aggregate (RA) to produce recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is a proven way of decreasing the consumption of natural aggregate (NA) and the landfilling of construction and demolition waste. However, adoption of codes for the design of RAC and RAC structures has been lacking.
