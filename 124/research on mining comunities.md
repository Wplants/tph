This work means that the problems associated with the development of a mining project can be approached from a multi-group vision, benefiting all parties involved: Mining companies: They will have more detailed knowledge of the cost associated with managing communities affected by their projects. They may wish to internalise this knowledge and take it into account in the early phases of a project, prior to implementations in later stages that are often blocked by residents' opposition.
