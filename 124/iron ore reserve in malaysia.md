## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production (+ Top Uses 
Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.
