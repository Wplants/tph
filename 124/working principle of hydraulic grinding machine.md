The working of a grinding machine: A grinder features an electric motor that supplies motion power to the grinding wheel using pulley and belt. For the portable grinder, the rotor is inside the grinding machine and the power switch is located beside the handle of a grinder. So, the switch must be pressed before the grinder works.
