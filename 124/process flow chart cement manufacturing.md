At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and ready to produce concrete. The first step in the process of making concrete is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel in the proportion of 15%, 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. This mixture is then put into a concrete mixer to produce concrete, which is used for building purposes.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.
