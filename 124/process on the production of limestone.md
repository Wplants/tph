## Limestone Mining Process
Sep 9, 2021Calcium carbonate can be directly processed into stone and burned into quicklime, but it is also dangerous in the production process. Quicklime becomes slaked lime by absorbing moisture or adding water, and slaked lime is also called hydrated lime.  The output of common limestone crushing sand making production line is t/h, t/h

## process of limestone for cement productiona
Slag cement is the byproduct of steel production. It is formed by the molten slag in blast furnaces used to process iron ore to make steel. Finely ground limestone can replace 5% to 15% of portland cement. Portland-limestone cements require less energy to produce because the limestone is not pyroprocessed like the portland cement it replaces.
