## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Mining all of the reef, all of the time
South Africa's reef deposits, especially gold and platinum-bearing ore bodies, are narrow and tabular. While legislation dictates a minimum operation height of 800 mm in areas where people work, some of the country's narrow reef mines have ore bodies with thicknesses of less than 500 mm, which results in ore dilution, as waste ore with zero economic value is also mined.

## Sustainable Mining - Africa Sustainability Matters
Mining is not about to stop. It has made countries like South Africa rich and even brought about controversies like the fake gold scam witnessed in Kenya. What should be done is to reduce the negative impacts on the environment and wildlife. Various methods can be implemented so as to shun and regulate the environmental impacts of mining.
