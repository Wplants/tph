Purified Water. Purified water is intended for use in formulation of medicines that are not intended to be sterile and apyrogenic. Purified water is widely used for oral and topical products and in granulation processes for tablets and capsules. It is also the feed water for the production of water for injection (WFI) and for pharmaceutical

## The Future of Water Purification for Pharma Could be Polypropylene
In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the use of stainless steel piping in water purification systems has long been the standard. Recently, however, using polypropylene up to the point of distillation is challenging the status quo, and for good reason. Let's begin with some background on the safety standards within the pharmaceutical industry.

## Design & Control of Pharma Water System to Minimize  - ISPE
Cold water systems. Systems for purified water typically use ozone, ultraviolet light, and in-line filters to maintain microbial quality instead of high temperature. Important points to consider are: Ozone is used periodically for sanitization. It attacks the outer surfaces of microorganisms and destroys cell walls and membranes.

It is important to understand that water, and any purification system that is used to produce Purified Water provides an excellent environment for microbial growth. Thus, the design of a water purification system is a crucial matter. A poorly designed and/or poorly monitored system can result in the contamination of the water that it produces.
