A core is usually made of the best quality sand and is placed into desired position in the mould cavity. Core prints are added to both sides of the pattern to create impressions that allow the core to be supported and held at both ends. When the molten metal is poured, it flows around the core and fill the rest of the mould cavity.

## Sand Cores Isoset | Supreme Cores
Isoset ( SO2 ) The Isoset Process uses a blend of dry sand mixed with a two part resin, blown into a "corebox" to form a sand core. Core boxes are typically made of some type of metal urethane or wood. A small amount of Sulfur Dioxide gas is then purged through the sand and out vents in the core box.

## Advances in Core Making Technology - Foundry Management & Technology
When the core is partially cured, it can be taken from the core box, thoroughly dried, and placed in a mold. After solidification, cores can be mechanically removed or placed in water and the binder dissolved. The system eliminates the need for a gas scrubber around the core machines and reduces ventilation requirements around work areas.

## Sand Casting Process, Defects, Design
The sand casting process involves the use of a furnace, metal, pattern, and sand mold. The metal is melted in the furnace and then ladled and poured into the cavity of the sand mold, which is formed by the pattern. The sand mold separates along a parting line and the solidified casting can be removed.

The full assembly is often times referred to as the "core package". Rather than have a steel mold to form the outer casting surfaces, the resin-bonded sand in the core packages forms all the surfaces. The actual casting process takes place when the molten aluminum is poured or injected into the core package.

We produce sand cores in-house using two core making processes: The Isocure™ Core Making Process. Isocure cores are produced using a "cold-box" core making process. That is, in the Isocure coring making process, no heat is applied to the core box. An Isocure Core is produced using silica sand mixed with a phenolic urethane resin used as a binding material. This core sand mixture is blown into the core-box. Along with heated air, a vaporized amine gas catalyst is then purged thru the core sand.

The core sand is pushed through a die onto a core plate. The use of these machines is limited to the production of stock cores: the long, extruded cylinder created by the machine is baked and then cut into desired lengths. Core driers are like cake pans in that they support the shape of a core while it is in the core oven baking. These are usually light skeleton iron or aluminum boxes, the internal shape of which conforms closely to the cope portion of the core.

When the pattern is removed, its impression leaves an empty area in the mould, which is eventually filled with steel to complete the casting.

Using this process, fine AFS graded sand is coated with a resin and blown into a pre-heated core box, ideally made from cast iron, which contains the desired shape. The surface is heated to °C, depending on the required core. This allows the chemical components in the sand to bond together and form the shape within the core box.
