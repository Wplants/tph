## Making of Fused Quartz and Fused Silica - QSI Quartz
Historically, the first method of producing fused quartz was by small-scale fusion of quartz crystals in a flame. Heraeus chemist Richard KÃ¼ch first began fusing quartz rock crystal in a hydrogen/oxygen (H2/O2) flame more than 100 years ago. Heraeus has been producing quartz glass on an industrial scale with this process ever since.
