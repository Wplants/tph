## Stampede Creek and the Legacy of Mining: Antimony in Stream Water and 
When the exposure of antimony orebodies to oxidizing surface environments (air) is accelerated through mining, the weathering of the sulfide-rich ores results in the release of oxidized metals (e.g. iron, copper, lead), metalloids (e.g. arsenic, antimony), and sulfuric acid to the local surface and near-surface waters.

## Geochemical behaviors of antimony in mining-affected water  - PubMed
Abstract Antimony (Sb) is a harmful element, and Sb pollution is one of the typical environmental issues in China, meaning that understanding of the geochemical behaviors of Sb is the key to control the fate of environmental Sb pollution. Sb tends to migrate in soluble form in the water-sediment system, but the fate of dissolved Sb is poorly known.
