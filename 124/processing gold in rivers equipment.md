## Finding Gold in a River - Gold Fever Prospecting
Gold is found in lode deposits, residual deposits, alluvial deposits, bench deposits, streambed deposits, ancient rivers, and flood layers. A lode deposit is a crack or fissure in hardrock that's full of gold. This is the original source of placer deposits. Residual deposits are pieces of ore that have eroded away from a lode.

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.

## Do All Rivers Have Gold in Them? - Prospectingplanet
Technically, all rivers do contain some small amounts of gold, but in most locations, it's so little that it can't be mined successfully. Moreover, not all rivers will contain gold in the same quantities. Due to the geological formation and history of specific locations, you will have more or fewer chances of finding valuable deposits.
