## Preferential sequence crushing of copper ore based upon high-voltage 
1. Introduction. Crushing plays an important role in the process of mineral processing. It consumes a large amount of energy and has a decisive influence on the downstream processing (Wang et al., 2012).High voltage pulses are a new type of crushing method, which has found wide range applications in the field of mineral processing due to its selective crushing advantages (Shi et al., 2014).

## Copper extraction
The copper ore is crushed and ground to a size such that an acceptably high degree of liberation has occurred between the copper sulfide ore minerals and the gangue minerals. The ore is then wetted, suspended in a slurry, and mixed with xanthates or other reagents, which render the sulfide particles hydrophobic.
