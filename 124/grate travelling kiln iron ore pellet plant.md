## grate kiln plant
In the Grate-Kiln process the traveling grate is used to dry and preheat the pellets. Material moves on straight travelling grate till it attains the temperature of 800°C to 1000°C. Thereafter it is transferred to refractory lined rotary kiln for induration where the temperature is further raised up-to °C.

## Chemical Process In Kiln And Mill
The rotary kiln is the heart of a cement manufacturing plant. Cement kilns have all chemical ingredients. These. ingredients are at a broad range of gas temperatures from 100° to 1650°C. The emissions contain: High concentrations of alkaline solids, including sodium and potassium oxides; High concentrations of freshly created Calcium Oxide.
