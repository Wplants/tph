## 12: Gypsum materials | Pocket Dentistry
Gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate) is a naturally occurring mineral used in dentistry to fabricate models ( Figure 12.1a ), casts and dies ( Figure 12.1b ). Calcination is the process of heating the gypsum to dehydrate it (partially or completely) to form calcium sulphate hemihydrate. Plaster and stone are products of the dehydration process.
