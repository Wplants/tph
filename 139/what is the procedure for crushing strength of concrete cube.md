## Compressive Strength of Concrete Test Procedure | Cube Test of Concrete 
Compressive strength of concrete cube test is the most important strength test for concrete. This single test gives an idea about all the characteristics of concrete. Concrete are very strong in compression. It is assumed that whole of the compression will be taken up by the concrete at the time designing any RCC structure.

2. Tensile Strength Test. The mortar prepared is placed in a mould of bracket that has a central cross-sectional area as 38 mm × 38 mm. After curing, the briquette (above fig) is pulled under the grips of the tensile testing machine. The ultimate load noted. Then the tensile strength of mortar is load divided from the central cross-sectional area.

##  CONCRETE - Boral
Strength of concrete The compressive strength of concrete is measured by how much force is required to crush it, this is important in the design of structures. In pavements and other slabs on the ground, the design is usually based on flexural strength, (i.e.; how much force the concrete can withstand in bending before it breaks).

## Compressive Strength of Cement Concrete - Cube Test, Procedure
The cube can be tested after 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. Cube is placed in compression testing machine and axial load is applied at the rate of 140 kg/ cm2. In actual concrete is required sufficient time to gain strength. Usually 28 days strength is considered as the full strength of concrete.
