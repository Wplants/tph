## The Vertical Miller - ENGINEERING
A vertical miller is used to shape metals such as mild steel and aluminium. It can also be used to shape plastics such as perspex and nylon. Full size milling machines such as the one shown below are powerful but also very accurate/precise. The cutting tools are very expensive and are broken easily if the machine operator tries to take too deep

Hold your hand out palm up with your thumb and index finger pointed outwards, and your middle finger pointed upwards. Place your hand in front of your CNC machine, aligned with the machine's spindle, and you'll see the axes line up perfectly. Middle finger is the Z-axis. Index finger is the Y-axis. Thumb is the X-axis.

## Vertical and Horizontal Milling Machines: Key Points of Difference 
For vertical milling machines, the rotary cutting head is vertically aligned, causing the spindle to traverse up and down along the Z-axis while the machine continues with regular operation. As the spindle moves, the cutters steadily take out material while the rest of the machine shifts along the X-axis and Y-axis to ensure that the object is

This orientation enables the milling head to work on the side or end of a workpiece gripped in either spindle from any angle. On other turn-mill machines, though, the linear motion that enables a second spindle or subspindle to approach the main spindle for a workpiece pick-off is referred to as a B axis.

Vertical Milling Machines. Cost significantly less — With verticals available at $80K and horizontals running from $250K to $400K, it's not surprising that machine shops purchase verticals over horizontals at a rate of four times or greater on an annual basis. Ease of use — It's easier to see what's going on inside a vertical mill.

Jan 6, 2021Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. It covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. A milling machine is operated manually or through CNC (Computer Numerical Control).

## Understanding the CNC Milling Process - MF Engineering
The CNC milling machine combines the accuracy of computerized controls to rotate and position multi-point cutting tools. As the raw stock progresses through the pre-programmed machining operation, a tool moves along the three primary axes, X, Y, and Z to precisely cut away material. For intricate and complex geometries, a 5-axis CNC milling
