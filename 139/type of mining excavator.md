## How to size and get the most out of your Mining Excavators  - The Scoop
Configure your mining excavators appropriately with boom and arm options. Some customers prefer a longer reach, while others want as big a bucket as possible to load more material, which requires a shorter boom and shorter arm. The most popular compromise between reach and the bigger bucket approach is a hybrid â€” a standard boom and short arm.
