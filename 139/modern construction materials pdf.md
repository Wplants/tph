In 25 years, the total global warming potential of a traditional building will be 20% higher than that of a modern building. If local materials, such as wood, are used in building construction, the emissions from production and transportation could be dramatically reduced.

saw table is hazardous in many ways; most modern table saws are of the tilt-arbor type. To rip stock, remove the cutoff gauges and set the rip fence away from the saw by a distance equal to the desired width of the piece to be ripped off. The piece is placed with one edge against the fence and fed through with the fence as a guide.

The history of building is marked by a number of trends. One is the increasing durability of the materials used. Early building materials were perishable, such as leaves, branches, and animal hides. Later, more durable natural materials—such as clay, stone, and timber—and, finally, synthetic materials—such as brick, concrete, metals, and

## What Are Modern Construction Materials?
Modern construction materials are those that can be found in high-rises, airports, and in the world of construction itself. These materials are sturdy and durable, yet are lightweight enough to be created with a minimal amount of manual labor or specialized tools. Steel is perhaps the most common building material used today.
