## Lithium
Lithium (from Greek: λίθος, romanized: lithos, lit. 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal.Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element.Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as

Increasing rare earth mining outside of China has reduced China's global share of mining, down from 97.7% in 2010 to 62.9% in 2019. But mining is merely one piece of the puzzle. Ultimately, the large majority of rare earth refining, 80%, resides in China. Therefore, even rare earths mined overseas are sent to China for final processing.
