How to Processing Gold Ore. Gold Ore Processing begins with comminution process then followed by metalurgy process. Comminution is the reduction in the size of the ore so that the valuable minerals containing gold to liberation gold mineral from other minerals that contained in the rocks. Comminution process is required in the primary gold ore

## 4 Extraction Processes for Gold-Pyrite Ore - Mining-pedia
The characteristic of process I is that the ore is directly roasted and then cyanided. This process is suitable for mines with small production scale and high grade. For example, a gold concentrator processes typical iron-gold ore, with a processing capacity of 200 tons/day and a gold grade of 10 grams/ton. All ores are calcined in a rotary
