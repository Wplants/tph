## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete.

## Difference between Fine Aggregate & Coarse Aggregate - DecorChamp
Sand, gravel or crushed stone are the essential ingredients in the concrete mix and account approximately 60% to 75% of the total volume of the concrete. In simpler words, the composite material that is used for binding the concrete is known as aggregate. It is categorized into two distinct categories fine and coarse aggregates.

## Types of Fine Aggregate - Civil Engineering
The aggregates passing 4.75 mm tyler sieve and retained on .075 mm sieve are classified as Fine Aggregate. Types of Fine Aggregate. Usually, sand, crushed stone, and crushed bricks are used as fine aggregate in concrete or pavement construction. Sand. Sand is an important engineering material. In concrete works, sand is used as a fine aggregate.
