The coal is taken out, processed, and sold. Taking away layer after layer of land creates a gigantic, open hole or pit. Explosives like dynamite are used when miners want to remove large blocks of materials. Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the coal is exhausted, or an increasing ratio of overburden makes further mining
