How do Rock Crushers Work? Most rock crusher machines are fitted with hoppers at their top ends. These are containers which keep the rock elevated above the crusher, using gravity to feed it with more rocks for crushing. Some rock crushers are fed via the help of a conveyor belt, which continually transports rock into the machines for crushing.
