## How Blades Are Made | Our Manufacturing Process | York Saw
There's a three-step process to hardening: Hardening: Iron-based steel alloys get sent to a furnace with temperatures set at 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This is below the melting point but sufficient for letting metallurgical changes take place. The metal type determines how long the blade stays at this heat.
