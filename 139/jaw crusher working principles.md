Working Principle of a Jaw Crusher. A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The

Jaw crusher works When the jaw crusher is working, the movable jaws make periodic reciprocating motions to the fixed jaws, sometimes approaching and sometimes leaving. When approaching, the material is crushed, split, and impacted between the jaws; when it is removed, the broken material is discharged from the discharge opening by gravity.
