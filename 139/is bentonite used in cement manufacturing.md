## How is fiber cement board manufacture - Fiber Cement Panels Calcium 
Fiber cement board manufacturing process also makes use of autoclave technology. In autoclave technology, polymer based composites are manufactured by applying intense heat and pressure to eliminate moisture from fibre cement materials. This leads to composite consolidation and the result is an extremely strong and robust fibre composite material.
