Extraction and refining TiCl 4. The production of titanium metal accounts for only 5 percent of annual titanium mineral consumption; the rest goes to the titanium pigment industry. Pigments are produced using either a sulfate process or a more environmentally acceptable carbo-chlorination process (described below) that converts TiO 2 into TiCl 4.The latter process also supplies the TiCl 4

Titanium is present in ash of coal, in plants, and in human body. The metal was a laboratory curiosity until Kroll, in 1946, showed that titanium could be produced commercially by reducing titanium tetrachloride with magnesium. This method is still largely used for producing the metal. The metal can be purified by decomposing the iodide.

## Titanium Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the production of titanium dioxide by the sulfate process finely ground ilmenite (FeTiO 3) or ilmenite slag is digested with sulfuric acid in a concentration of about 90% and the cleaned titanium oxide sulfate is hydrolyzed to form titanium oxide hydrate, which is then calcined to form TiO 2. Modern plants incorporate a downstream dilute

## Preparation of titanium dioxide nanostructure from ilmenite through 
In this study, TiO 2 nanoparticles have been obtained from low-grade ilmenite ore via two consecutive acid digestion and solvent extraction processes. The as-extracted TiO 2 (Anatase phase) product was characterized using techniques such as XRD, XRF, FESEM, FTIR and BET surface area.

plant operated for a total of 133 hours for the iron extraction and 163 hours for titanium extraction processes. Iron oxide and titanium dioxide powders were produced on batch-basis from the pilot-scale hydrometallurgical strip solutions. A 98.5% pure Fe 2 O 3 powder was generated via precipitation and calcination. A crystalline rutile TiO 2
