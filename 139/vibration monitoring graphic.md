Vibration Amplitude. The maximum amplitude or range of the vibration you are measuring determines the sensor range that you can use. If you attempt to measure vibration outside a sensor's range, it distorts or clips the response. Typically, accelerometers used to monitor high vibration levels have a lower sensitivity and lower mass. Sensitivity
