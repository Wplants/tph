## How to Treat Wastewater from Iron and Steel Industry? | Waste Management
In this article we will discuss about the methods and procedures to treat and control wastewater from iron and steel industry. The iron and steel industry, as treated here, includes pig iron production, steel making, rolling operations and those finishing operations common in steel mills, i.e. cold reduction, tin plating and galvanising.

Iron and steel slags are coproducts of iron and steel manufacturing. In the production of iron, the blast furnace is charged with iron ore, fluxing agents, usually limestone and dolomite, and coke as fuel and the reducing agent. The iron ore is a mixture of iron oxides, silica, and alumina. From this and the added fluxing agents molten slag and

## Review on the innovative uses of steel slag for waste minimization 
Disposal of slag is the major issue for the steel industries as huge space is required for its dumping. Dumping of slag on the agricultural land often creates protest by farmers for the disposal of the slag waste by the industry [].Near Jamshedpur in India, where most of the steel industries are established, the people with low- to very low income reside near those waste dumping yards.

In India, the Steel Industry is producing an estimated 24 million tonnes of iron slag and 12 million tonnes of steel slag every year. Open area disposal/landfill of iron slag possess a threat to the environment and an alternate way of iron slag waste management must be developed to reduce the environmental effects associated with it.
