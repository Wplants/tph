## A Review Paper on use of Recycled Aggregates in Concrete
A. Recycled Aggregate Concrete. Recycling is the act of processing the used material for use in creating a new product. The usage of natural aggregate is getting more and more intense with the advanced development in infrastructure area. Recycled aggregate is comprised of crushed, graded inorganic particles processed.

##  Aggregates from Natural and Recycled Sources - USGS
How much does it cost to produce recycled aggregates? Entry into the aggregates recycling business requires a capital investment of $4 to $8 per metric ton of annual capac-ity, a cost that is most significant for a small producer because of economies of scale. Processing costs for the aggregates recycler range from about $2.50 to $6 per metric ton.

## An Overview of Recycled Concrete Aggregate | ETM Recycling
There are several advantages of using recycled concrete aggregate, these include: It's a cheaper alternative to quarried stone. It's a very durable material and particularly suitable for wet or soft ground. It uses less energy in production than traditional concrete. It does not require mining and so preserves natural environments.

Recycled aggregate comes primarily from PCC and AC from road rehabilitation and maintenance, demolition, and leftover batches of AC and PCC. After processing, the rocks retain bits of cement or asphalt. A roadway is built in several layers: pavement, base, and sometimes subbase. The pavement is the surface layer, and is made of PCC or AC.

## Benefits of Using Recycled Aggregate in Concrete
With the cost of quarried aggregates increasing and the quality of recycled materials improving, recycled aggregates are gaining popularity as a cost-effective and handy option. Previously, leftover aggregate was disposed of in landfills; however, recycling it is now considered very useful for a variety of reasons.

## recycled concrete Topic - American Concrete Institute
The reason for recycling is the reduction of waste in order to protect nature against pollution, the increasing shortage of suitable dumping grounds, and to save energy and natural resources. Concrete debris is typically reclaimed as recycled aggregate (RCA). By recycling concrete, valuable landfill space and natural resources are preserved.
