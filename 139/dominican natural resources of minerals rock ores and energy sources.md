## List of Natural Resources | Earth and Human
By Nina Howell June 8, 2020. Natural resources refer to the resources that exist on Earth independent of any human actions. These generally fall under one of two categories: renewable and non-renewable resources. Natural resources are also the essence behind what forms mother Earth. These include air, water, soil, minerals, as well as metals.
