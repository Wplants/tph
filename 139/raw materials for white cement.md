The quality of cement clinker is directly related to the chemistry of the raw materials used. Around 80-90% of raw material for the kiln feed is limestone. Clayey raw material accounts for between 10-15%, although the precise amounts will vary. Magnesium carbonate, which may be present in limestone, is the main undesirable impurity. The level

## Portland cement
Portland cement clinker is made by heating, in a cement kiln, a mixture of raw materials to a calcining temperature of above 600 °C (1,112 °F) and then a fusion temperature, which is about 1,450 °C (2,640 °F) for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker.. The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracalcium alumino ferrite.

## White Cement
It is readily available throughout North America. The color of white cement is determined by its raw materials and the manufacturing process. Metal oxides, primarily iron and manganese, influence the whiteness and undertone of the material. After adding pigments, white cements produce clean, bright colors, especially for light pastels.

## Investigation of Raw Material for the Manufacturing of White Cement in 
The annual production of cement in N.W.F.P. is about tons [5]. All these cement plants produce high strength Portland cement and sulfate resisting cement. Until now there is no plant in our province which is producing white cement due to the lack of raw material. Therefore white cement is imported from other provinces of the country.

The main materials used in cement production are minerals containing calcium oxide, silex, alumina and iron oxide. These components are rarely found in one type of raw material; therefore, for the cement production the raw mix is selected for the following components: CARBONATE COMPONENT (rich in calx) is contained in the raw mix in a quantity

## How do you make white cement stronger?hcharge
Is white cement strong? Production of white concrete with a compressive strength between 25 and 50 Mpa is possible by using white cement. It was also found out in study that white concrete had higher compressive strength than normal gray concrete. The strength in opc cement comes from calcium aluminate present in it.

## Why strength of white cement is less than OPC cement?
The production of white cement requires 40% more energy than OPC and this more heat requirement for burning of raw materials in snowcrete and more energy consumption also leads to lesser strength. Fineness of white cement is 395m2/kg which is also higher than OPC.

Requirement of White Cement Raw Material. The mineral composition of white cement clinker is basically the same as that of ordinary portland cement (OPC) clinker, mainly C 3 S and C 2 S. The difference is that there is little iron phase mineral C 4 AF in white cement clinker, which is because Fe 2 O 3 has a great impact on the whiteness of cement.

## 8 Main Cement Ingredients & Their Functions - Civil Engineering
Excess Sulfur Trioxide causes the cement to unsound. Alkaline: It should not be present more than 1%. Excess Alkaline matter causes efflorescence. Chemical Formulas of Cement Materials. Cement is made of different chemical components as discussed above. Cement chemical composition is dependent on the chemical composition of these ingredients.

## Cement Mosaic Flooring Tiles - techno-preneur
The basic raw materials used in the manufacture of mosaic floor tiles are cement (grey and white) stone/marble chips. Fine aggregates like sand, dolomite powder and colouring oxide ordinary portland cement can be used for mosaic tiles of dull colours.  however, there would be some air pollution while handling dry raw materials like cement
