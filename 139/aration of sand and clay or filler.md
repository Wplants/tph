## separation of sand and clay or filler
There are numerous varieties of sand available on the earth. It is simply, made of tiny particles of worn-down rock, which are picked up by the wind, water or the ice in glaciers and left as sediment in the ocean or as sand dunes on land. Unlike clay, even sand is used for construction, industries, filtration and coloring purposes.

## Soil and Foundation Challenges | Ground Improvement Techniques - GEOSOLV
This clay can shrink or swell upon changes in moisture content. This can lead to subsidence or settlement. Soil heave is also an issue when it comes to clay, and swelling clay in particular, having the potential to push the foundation and the structure above upwards. Another unique clay exists in the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Valleys.

## Does Sand Improve Clay Soil Drainage? - University of Illinois Extension
When sand mixes with clay, it creates a soil structure akin to concrete. To create a real change in a clayey soil structure, you would need to add a 1:1 ratio of sand to clay. Considering the actual volume of clay soil underfoot, that equates to a lot of sand. It is far more practical to use organic matter to help break up clay soil.

## Should you add sand to garden soil? The pros and cons
Sand particles are much larger than clay, so fewer particles are required to fill the same space that the clay would fill with many particles. The result is that sand has a much small overall surface area and, therefore, when compared to clay, has much less of an influence on the soil's properties and characteristics.

However, the percentage of these can vary, resulting in more compound types of soil such as loamy sand, sandy clay, silty clay, etc. 2. State the characteristics of sandy soil. Sandy soil essentially consists of small particles formed by weathering rocks.

Sand added to clay as a soil amendment can produce a very hard dense soil--unless at least 50 percent of the mixture is sand. Otherwise the clay particles fill the voids between the sand particles and the result is even more dense than before.

## Differences Between Sand, Silt, And Clay? - Knowledgebase Question - Garden
Sand is the largest particle, silt the intermediate, and clay the smallest. Sandy soil drains well, but doesn't retain moisture and fertilizer well so more applications are needed. Clay soil doesn't drain as well, but retains moisture and fertilizer so fewer applications are needed. However, clay's poor drainage and aeration can cause roots to rot.

## How to Aerate the Lawn and Reduce Compaction
The secret is to do it frequently, preferably every month. Alternating the aeration with a hollow tine aerator or fork will considerably relieve the compaction. Afterwards, put the sprinkler on the area for 30 minutes and stay off it for a day or two. If the area gets worn out as well as compacted put a little grass seed in every time you aerate.
