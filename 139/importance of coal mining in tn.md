Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job. Many more perished from occupational diseases, but weren't tallied in official statistics. Miners were crushed to death in roof collapses, killed by gas explosions and by machinery, and more.

## What is coal used for? | U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

## Protected or not? Coal company pushes for mine in protected Tennessee 
The coal company seems to assume that it should have the right to mine on property it owns, where the state has relinquished surface rights. This argument, however, is not rooted in law, as such rights are not at issue within a LUM area. Rather, the designation confers protections upon the land itself, regardless of ownership or other legal claims.
