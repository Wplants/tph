## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

• Geology plays a role in the operational phase of a mine. Geologists must continually study the mineral deposit to guide mine engineers on the best way to develop the mine over time. This is called "Mine geology". • Geologists might also play a role in the reclamation part of the cycle when the mine is closing.
