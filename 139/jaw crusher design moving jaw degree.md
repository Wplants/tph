For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Jaw Crusher Plants | ELRUS Aggregate Equipment
Jaw Crushers. Jaw Crushers are used extensively throughout the world by the aggregate, mining and recycle industries. Their large physical size and rectangular feed opening enable them to receive a larger feed size than most other types of crushers. Rugged construction, simplicity of design and the ability to crush most types of material, including hard abrasive stone, make them ideally suited

Fig.3 shows the configuration of the jaw crusher and geometrical and operation parameters are given in Table 1. Jaw crusher mainly, consist of moving jaw, eccentric shaft, flywheel and toggle plate. The jaw has specific motion to break feed material by the means of eccentric shaft. while jaw width is 1100 mm, gaps from upper side is 650 mm.
