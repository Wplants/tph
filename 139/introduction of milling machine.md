## Introduction to Milling Machines and CNC Machining
Brief Introduction. Ordinary milling machine mainly refers to machine tools that use milling cutters to machine various surfaces of workpieces. Usually, the milling cutter mainly moves in a rotary motion, and the movement of the workpiece and the milling cutter is a feed motion. It can process planes, grooves, and various surfaces, gears, and so on. Simply put, a milling machine can machine a

## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Operation, Working Principle 
Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.

## CNC Milling: What is it, How It Works, Operations, Overview - IQS Directory
The milling process begins by inserting the workpiece into the CNC machine's work surface or holding device. This is followed by placement of the milling tools to the machine's spindle. The directionality of the milling process can be either horizontal or vertical depending on the requirements programmed from CAD.
