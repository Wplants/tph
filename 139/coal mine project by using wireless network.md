## Coal Mine Safety System Using Wireless Sensor Networks and RFID Technology
In designing the coal mine safety system, various systems have been proposed, in which the first system was developed using wired network. In 2005 YU et al proposed a real-time forest fire detection system based on wireless sensor network [1]. They designed the monitoring and detecting sensor networks using neural network.

## Using wireless underground sensor networks for mine and miner safety 
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a specific type of networks that link sensors and have the potential to greatly benefit monitoring of coal mine applications, underground mine safety and localization of miners. Such systems can monitor the underground environment in real-time, provide information about the localization of miners and production parameters thus enabling early warning. In this
