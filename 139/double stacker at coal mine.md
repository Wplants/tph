TAKRAF combined stacker / reclaimers are equipped with a bucket-wheel boom and are primarily employed where medium to high or even very high material flow rates are to be stacked and then later reclaimed by the same machine. Our typical machines cover the following flow rates and sizes: Stacking and reclaiming capacity: 500 t/h to 20,000 t/h.

Enestee Engineering Ltd. A stacking tube is not like a silo. Its a concrete hollow tube with windows in alternating directions. When it is filled with material the material flows out through the windows and makes a huge tall stockpile around the tube. There is a reclain tunnel below the tube into which the material is pushed using a showel.
