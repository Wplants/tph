Waterwheel. A waterwheel is a type of device that takes advantage of flowing or falling water to generate power by using a set of paddles mounted around a wheel. The falling force of the water pushes the paddles, rotating a wheel. This rotation of a wheel can be transmitted to a variety of machines through a shaft at the center of the wheel. [1]

Old watermills were the keystone of power generation a few centuries ago, and in most cases the hydro resource at a watermill site will be unchanged, so yes you should be able to generate using an old water mill. The key question is whether it will be possible to install a modern hydro system and make a reasonable return on investment.

## Watermill
A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower.It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering.Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills
