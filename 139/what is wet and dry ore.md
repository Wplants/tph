Where a dry coating is quite inevitable is everything where it is clear a priori that the rope will come in contact with water and/or snow, i.e. ice climbing and glacier hiking. In short. Rappelling on a wet rope is ugly but still OK - having a lead fall into a wet or even damp rope may be critical.

Dry Metric Tonne Unit. A Dry Metric Tonne (Ton) Unit (dmtu) is the internationally agreed-upon unit of measure for iron ore pricing. It has the same mass value as a metric tonne, but the material has been dried to decrease the moisture level. A dry metric ton unit consists of 1% of iron (Fe) contained in a tonne of ore, excluding moisture.

## What is the Difference Between Wet & Dry Fire Sprinkler Systems?
Rather, a dry fire sprinkler keeps pressurized air and/or nitrogen in the non-heated portions of the sprinkler pipes. This way, if and when temperatures drop below freezing, the pipes are not in danger of freezing. The way dry pipes work is the pressurized air or nitrogen holds a valve closed that separates the main piping from the water supply.

## Wet and Dry Thermal Oxide Difference
Wet thermal oxide usually uses wafer liquid that is grown on the wafer's crystalline structure. As the liquid evaporates, the crystals fall with it, creating a layer of solid oxide. When this layer dries, the oxide continues to grow, becoming a perfectly dry film. Wet thermal oxide, however, can be grown without using wafers, allowing it to be
