The primary underground mining ways are Continuous, Longwall, Shortwall, Retreat and Blast Mining. Longwall mining method is adopted for about 50% of underground mining. This method involves a complex machine with a revolving drum that sways mechanically back and forth across the coal deposit. This method yields high production and ensures safety.

Longwall mining involves underground coal mining, whereby a long wall of coal is mined via a single slice, and the slice is usually from two feet to a little over three feet thick. The block of coal being mined, which is called the longwall panel, is normally approximately 270 to 430 yards in width and two to three miles in length.

There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

## Mining : What is Mining? What are the 4 mining methods?
Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other
