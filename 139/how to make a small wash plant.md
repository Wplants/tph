## How to wash plants?145
How do you wash plants with soap? Mix roughly ¼ teaspoon mild liquid dish soap in 1 quart of lukewarm water. Spray the plant, rinse off with fresh water and, if possible, wipe-off the leaves with a soft, damp cloth. Ideally, do this outdoors in the shade or on a cloudy day. You can also clean larger plants in the shower or bath tub.
