## Thermal power plant - layout, working, advantages and limitations with PDF
A thermal power plant is a power generation station that converts the heat energy produced by the combustion of fuel into electric energy. The heat energy of the fuel is used to convert water into steam at high pressure. This high-pressure steam is passed over the turbine. The rotation of the turbine produces electricity with the help of a

Geothermal Power Plant Working Principle. Normally the thermal energy available inside the earth is at a depth of more than 80 km. The average temperature gradient in the earth's surface is 30 o C /km depth. Therefore, for power generation to attain temperatures up to 300 o C, a hole has to be drilled in earth's surface of about 10 km depth.

## Function Block (FB) for Motor Control Logic - Inst Tools
Function block (FB) logic is used for multiple logic applications. For example, there are two industrial motors in the application. Both the motors are operated in the same logic independently. So we will write logic in FB block for one motor function and use the same for other motors as well. (call FB 1 and FB 2 in OB 1).

A Combined cycle power plant is a highly efficient power generation unit. They are the cleanest and highly efficient. The process of combined cycle power generation recovers the temperature from the exhaust gas and utilizes that heat in power generation. It is believed that they produce around 50 percent more electricity from the same fuel consumption. So combined cycle power plants are

A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. [Rankine cycle] Coal is used as a fuel to heat water in a coal based thermal power plant.
