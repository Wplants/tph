## There's Gold in Those Endpoints: Threat Mining vs Threat Hunting
With threat mining, we expect false positives to be raised regularly. In true mining terms, these would be called "tailings.". One of the challenges with mining operations is how to deal with the tailings. Red Canary built a process for this. By planning for false positives, we are able to automate the findings of a hunt.

Jun 15, 2022According to Gold, 50% of all gold mined annually ends up in bank vaults. In this project, each token is backed by 1/100th of a gram of gold preserved in the ground as an underlying asset, as a hedge against volatility. This way the token holders could reap the benefit of gold while avoiding the environmental damage of mining.
