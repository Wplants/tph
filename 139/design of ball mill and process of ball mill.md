High temperature of the ball mill will affact the efficiency. 3 For every 1% increase in moisture, the output of the ball mill will be reduced by 8% -10%. 4 when the moisture is greater than 5%, the ball mill will be unable to perform the grinding operation. 5. The bearing of the ball mill is overheated and the motor is overloaded.

You also need a rod mill work index to design a ball mill operating on a coarse feed, above about 4 mm. Q1: You design for a typical percentage of critical speed, usually 75% of critical. Then you iterate the mill diameter using a Morrell C-model or Nordberg equation to get the RPM that corresponds to 75% for that mill diameter.

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between Â½" (13 mm) and Â¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.
