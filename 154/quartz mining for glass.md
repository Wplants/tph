## Is Quartz Sustainable? An Honest Look at the Facts
Some quartz countertops are even made with post-consumer recycled glass. In general, quartz is also regarded for its low emissions,  One study from the 1970s showed that quartz mining produced a significant amount of dust pollution. This dust pollution was found at all points of transit. It was found during production and transportation.

## The History of Glass Making - QSI Quartz
In the late 1950`s Sir Alastair Pilkington introduced a float glass production method by which 90% of flat glass is still manufactured today. After 1890, the development, manufacture and use of glass increased rapidly. Glass has evolved through advancing technologies and technological evolution naturally continues.

Dec 9, 2021Physical properties. Owing to its abundance and high thermal and chemical stability, quartz is widely used in many large-scale applications—abrasives, foundry materials, ceramics, and cements. Quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectricity is the ability to develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress.
