## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.
