For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate. The space at the bottom of the "V"-aligned jaw plates is the output gap that dictates the size of the crushed product from the jaw crusher.
