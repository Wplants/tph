Apr 24, 2022Water/cement ratio theory states that for a given combination of materials and as long as workable consistency is obtained, the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w/c ratio. The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.

## Mix Design Concrete Procedure - As Per Is Code | Grades of Concrete
Add an approx, quantity of water slowly to the dry mix, using a bucket. Check the capacity of the bucket. After adding water, mix all the materials until a uniform color and consistency appear. After visual inspection, if the color and consistency of concrete does not seem right, add 10% more cement in the same mix.

## Types of Concrete Mix Ratio Design and their Strengths
These mixes are termed standard mixes. IS has designated the concrete mixes into a number of grades as M10, M15, M20, M25, M30, M35 and M40. In this designation the letter M refers to the mix and the number to the specified 28 day cube strength of mix in N/mm 2 . The mixes of grades M10, M15, M20 and M25 correspond approximately to the

## What Concrete Mix to Use for a Driveway | Concrete Questions
The ideal ratio for a driveway is 0.50. You come by this number by dividing the amount of water you use in one cubic yard by the amount of cement in the mix (all in pounds). For example, if you have 470 pounds of cement, in order to get a ratio of 0.50, use the following formula: 470 x 0.50 = 235. So you would use 235 pounds of water in the
