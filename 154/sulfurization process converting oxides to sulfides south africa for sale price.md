## Lanthanum oxide sulfurization in ammonium rhodanide vapor
We have studied phase formation processes in the La-O-S system during La2O3 sulfurization in ammonium rhodanide vapor and identified the sequence of steps in lanthanum oxide conversion into oxysulfides and lanthanum sulfide using X-ray diffraction, IR absorption spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. In the initial stage of the sulfurization process, we observed the formation of lanthanum

The process is widely used to convert oxides to sulfides but is also related to corrosion and surface modification. Inorganic, materials, and organic chemistry. Sulfidation is relevant to the formation of sulfide minerals.. A large scale application of sulfidation is the

Calcium sulfate (CaSO4) is proposed as an alternative sulfur source to convert the Fe-Ni-Cu-Co alloy to the matte phase. Solid carbon was used as a reducing agent and the influence of oxide fluxes on the sulfurization efficiency at 1673 K (1400 Â°C) in a CO-CO2-SO2-Ar atmosphere was investigated.

Sep 6, 2021To prevent the occurrence of sulfurization, manufacturers have developed anti-sulfur technologies for components. There are generally two methods. The first is to use a layer of sulfur-resistant material to cover the electrode layer and avoid contacting the hydrogen sulfide. This method is more common and can effectively prevent sulfurization.
