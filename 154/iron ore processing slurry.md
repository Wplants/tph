## Paper: Pumping system design challenges for high-density iron ore 
Abstract: Fine iron ore tailings slurry is commonly deposited in tailings storage facilities across the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Many of these mines process ore from a combination of deposits such as Bedded Iron Deposits (BID), Channel Iron Deposits (CID) and Detrital Iron Deposits (DID), mixing the feed to obtain the product under contract.

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Iron ore processing. After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed.  The gangue remaining in the slurry is pumped off after froth flotation and disposed of. Magnetic separation. In magnetite-containing rock, there is another possibility of separating gangue and iron ore.

Jan 25, 2022Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## Tailings Management With Paste Thickening
In the concentrate thickener, the purified slurry is thickened prior to being pumped to a disc filter. Again, the addition of polymer aids in the separation and thickening process. The disc filter uses vacuum to dewater the magnetite iron ore concentrate and discharges a relatively dry cake, which is sent for pelletizing.

At this step, the "Frother" process (for example, fuel oil) is added to the ore slurry to form stable froth and air bubbles. The Iron oxide particles stick to the air bubbles and float. The floated and concentrated iron ore slurry is then skimmed from the surface of the water and removed by using a filter press.

## Processing - Citic Pacific Mining
Mar 31, 2022Sino Iron's processing plant is where we transform the magnetite ore into high quality, premium magnetite concentrate.  During the milling and separating process, the ore is mixed with water. In order for the ore to be efficiently pumped to the port area and prepared for export, the concentrate is thickened into a slurry form before it
