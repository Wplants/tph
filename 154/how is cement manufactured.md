## How do you make reinforced concrete? - VGC Group
Steelfixers use engineering drawings to put the steels together in a frame which will eventually be the steel reinforcement in the wall. Then shuttering carpenters fix sheets of treated plyboard on the outsides of the frame. They're carefully bolted in place. You end up with a 'mould' shape of the wall, with steel reinforcements through it.

## Manufacturing process
Step 1: Mining. The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded

## What is Cement and How it is Manufactured? - The Machine Design
A cement is a binding substance, used to bind other buildings or civil construction material like bricks, stones, gravels, tiles, etc. Cement can be set and hardened independently and can bind other building materials together. It is a very fine powder containing limestone, clay, silica, and alumina. Also contained with bauxite and iron oxide.

The weight (relative atomic mass) of sodium is 23 and of chlorine is 35.5. If we add these together we get the formula weight of a sodium chloride molecule: 23+35.5=58.5. So, the proportion of sodium in sodium chloride is: 23/58.5 x 100% = 39.3% by mass. The proportion of chlorine in sodium chloride is: 35.5/58.5 x 100% = 60.7% by mass.
