## Fossil fuel power station
Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on the planet, and widely used as the source of energy in thermal power stations and is a relatively cheap fuel. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more greenhouse gas and pollution than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant

Nuclear generation is also somewhat lower in this case through 2040, as the absence of the Clean Power Plan moves more coal into the lower-cost segment of the dispatch order. Market-clearing dispatch prices, which are already held down by low natural gas prices, fall even lower, leading to some additional retirements of nuclear power plants.
