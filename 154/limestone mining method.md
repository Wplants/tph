Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale. The float ore area is dug up manually with picks, crow bars, and spades, and then the material is manually screened and then stacked up.  This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke

## Limestone Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage
The cheapest small particle size material in mining areas is "rock dust" of which 60 to 70 percent passes a 200 mesh. To obtain a smaller size, a cost in excess of that paid for lime may be required.  Preoxidation of the ferrous iron before limestone neutralization is one method of solving the problem. Working against this method is the
