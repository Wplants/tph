## Process Development Essential to Bentonite Processing Operations
Drying Bentonite. Bentonite, as mined, typically contains between 25-35% moisture and requires drying to 5% to 12%. This is often accomplished through the use of a rotary drum dryer. While drying can be a fairly straightforward task in mineral processing, bentonite requires special attention, as overdrying risks diminished performance of the clay.
