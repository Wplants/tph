A screw conveyor is a conveyor system which, as mentioned above, transports goods according to the Archimedean screw principle. The image of a conveying system with a flexible screw is to illustrate how a conveying spiral works. The suction pipe of a screw conveyor can be used as a hopper due to its U-shaped loading chute.

Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

Oct 10, 2021So, the capacity of the conveyor in 5 minute is ( (505)/25)  2. ie, 20 nos. So the capacity of this particular conveyor is 20 parts in 5 minutes or it will move 1 part in 15 Seconds. Hence the formula for the conveyor capacity is, ( (conveyor speed  time)/ (length of part))  no of parts along width of conveyor.
