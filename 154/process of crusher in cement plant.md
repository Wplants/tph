## Cement Manufacturing Technologies - DSMAC
Typically, cement raw materials crushing plant locations are based upon the availability of good quality limestone in the vicinity. The quarrying operations are done by the cement producer using the open cast mining process. The quarried limestone is normally in the form of big boulders, ranging from a few inches to meters in size.
