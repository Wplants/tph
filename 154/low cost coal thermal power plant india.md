## Thermal Power Plant - Components, Working and Site Selection
So, due to the number of energy conversions, the efficiency of thermal power plants is very low around 20-29%. The efficiency of a thermal power plant is also depending on the size of the plant and the quality of coal. In a thermal power plant, the heat energy is lost in the condenser. There are two types of efficiency in thermal power plants.

A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.
