## Cement Production Process | Cement Manufacturing Process | AGICO CEMENT
There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

## Materials and procedure of producing cement
Based on thedifferent types and qualities of raw materials, cement is produced in two main "wet and dry" procedures. Though there are some other procedures, today dry procedure is often used in producing cement except for the cases that the raw material requires the wet procedure since in the dry way less energy is needed.
