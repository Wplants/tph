Finally, the cement is packaged in large bags. Cement is one of the four raw materials that are used in the production of concrete, along with gravel, sand and water. To be exact, concrete consists of 50% gravel, 25% sand, 15% cement and 10% water. All four materials are blended together in a rotating machine called a concrete mixer.

## The Difference Between Cement & Concrete - Concrete Alberta
Through a process called hydration, the cement and water harden and bind the aggregates into a rock-like mass. This hardening process continues for years meaning that concrete gets stronger as it gets older. So, there is no such thing as a cement sidewalk, or a cement mixer; the proper terms are concrete sidewalk and concrete mixer.

Determining the percentage of water to add to cement is a technical process. If too much water is added, the resulting concrete can be weak and susceptible to breakage. But if too little water is added, it will be difficult to shape and finish the concrete before it sets. Cement, aggregates and concrete are the basic foundation of all concrete

A good quality concrete is essentially a homogeneous mixture of cement, coarse and fine aggregates and water which consolidates into a hard mass due to chemical action between the cement and water. Each of the four constituents has a specific function. The coarser aggregate acts as a filler.
