##  Report on Artisanal & Small-scale Mining in Africa Selected Countries 
In Africa, women make up around half the ASM workforce. As part of ongoing research in addition to this report, AMDC, in partnership with the African Centre for Gender at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, produced a study on women in artisanal and small-scale mining in five countries, highlighting key gender-related challenges.

## Small-scale mining — opportunities and challenges
Small-scale mining offers opportunities, but there are many challenges, writes Kgothatso 'KayG' Nhlengetwa. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a worldwide phenomenon that is practiced predominantly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It is estimated that 20-30 million people are employed by the sector worldwide. ASM has been on the rise in South

## Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi: Small-Scale Mining Conference | South 
Small-scale mining is a permanent feature of the economic landscape of most mineral rich countries in the world, including South Africa. One just has to look carefully in the rural areas to spot the level of small-scale mining activities in terms of diamond mining, quarrying, clay and sand mining, to name a few examples.

## Bringing South Africa's Small-Scale Miners Out of the Shadows
In a country with unemployment rising above 25 percent, South Africans are increasingly looking for job creation in small-scale mining, an often-informal industry that provides a living for millions across the continent. Estimates for the number of small-scale miners in South Africa range from 8,000 to 30,000.

Whilst the latter is often undertaken by big companies, requires a substantial labour force and operations continue until sites ares completely excavated, ASM on the other hand is carried out by small groups who travel around to identify sites
