## Types of Surface Mining | American Mine Services
In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

The long residence time of the gold within the grinding circuit can cause some of the GRG to become non-gravity recoverable due to smearing on to grinding media, mill liners and gangue minerals. This effect is minor as more than 98% of the GRG entering the ball mill remains gravity recoverable after grinding (LaPlante, 2000).
