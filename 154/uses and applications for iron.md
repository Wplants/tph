## Pig iron: definition, applications, properties, composition 
Properties of pig iron. Pig iron is also known as crude iron. It is obtained from a smelting furnace in the form of oblong blocks and has a very high carbon content of 3.5 - 4.5 as it contains 90% of iron. It is produced by smelting iron ore with high-carbon fuel and reductant such as, coke usually with limestone which serves flux.

What is Cast Iron? Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2 to 4 percent. In addition, varying amounts of silicon from 1 to 3% by weight and manganese as well as traces of impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus. Cast iron is made by reducing Iron Ore in a Blast Furnace.

Wrought iron is an alloy of iron having very low (less than 0.08%) amount of carbon in it. It contains some amount (up to 2%) of slag which gives it fibrous appearance. It can also contain a very small amount of Silicon, Sulfur and Phosphorous. It is very pure iron where the iron content can be up to 99.5%. It is produced by remelting pig iron.

Iron is an essential element for all forms of life and is non-toxic. The average human contains about 4 grams of iron. A lot of this is in haemoglobin, in the blood. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to the cells, where it is needed for tissue respiration. Humans need 10-18 milligrams of iron each day.
