## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? - Bright Hub Engineering
Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants, while producing power, require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2. Learn how the process works as well as interesting

Coal received from the mines is stored in the coal yard adjacent to the power plant. It is then conveyed on a daily basis to the boiler and stored in a 'Coal Silo'. 'Coal feeders' continuously feed the required amount of coal to the 'Coal Pulverisers'. Coal Pulverisers grind the coal to a very fine powder to make it burn easily.

At processing plants, physical properties are critical for the design and handling of biomass fuels and feedstocks. Compared with fossil fuels, woody biomass has a relatively low bulk density in raw state. Bituminous coal or crude oil, for example, has a volume of 30 dm 3 /GJ, while solid wood has around 90 dm 3 /GJ.

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

## Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal
In a broad sense, the geographic differences reflect the greater degree of coalification--the process that transformed plant material into coal under the influence of heat and pressure--in the coal-bearing areas in the East. In the Appalachian Coal Basin, the emission factors for bituminous coal range from a low of 202.8 pounds of carbon

## Do coal power plants produce sulfur dioxide? - Origin of coal
When coals are burned, leached and washed, sulfur will be released in the form of sulfide and H 2 S, which then react with O 2, water and other substances to change into vitriol, and in some places it may form acid rain. And they will impact water environment, acidify the soil and do great harm to plants and human health.

How a Coke Plant Works. Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful by-products that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first.

## How long does it take to process coal? - Short-Facts
The coal formation process takes millions of years. The coal in use today started to form over 300 million years ago as living trees, ferns and other types of plant material. Coal is a nonrenewable resource because the time it requires for formation far exceeds the rate at which man uses it.

## Do we really need coal to make steel? - Wildsight
From there, the coal is converted into coke and then used in the blast furnace-basic oxygen steelmaking process. Coal does three things in this process: it is burned to supply the huge amounts of heat required, it supplies gases to strip oxygen from the iron ore and roughly 1% of the coal ends up as carbon in the steel.

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

What do you know about coal? Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock with a high amount of carbon and hydrocarbons. Coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form. Coal contains the energy stored by plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swampy forests.

Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.
