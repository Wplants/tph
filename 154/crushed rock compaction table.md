## The creep compaction behavior of crushed mudstones under the step 
The crushed rocks are used as a filling material in mined-out areas of underground mining. Compared with the man-made filling materials, the crushed rocks exhibit higher compressibility and lower stability, which may result in instability of surrounding rock and surface subsidence. To study the creep compaction behavior of crushed mudstones, a series of creep tests are conducted. The

1. I looked at the gravel you are using. I would suspect you might see 1/2 to 3/4 inch of compaction, especially if you just laid it down. All you can do is start compaction, see what it looks like and add or rake off a bit to meet you needs. Pretty subjective answer, sorry.

## Swell Factors for Various Soils - ProjectEngineer
A cubic yard of earth measured in its natural position swells to more than a cubic yard after it is excavated. This occurs because of an increase in voids. Swell is expressed as a percentage of natural volume, for example, if 10 yd 3 in the ground becomes 13 yd 3 after excavation, the swell factor is 30%. The following table lists swell factors

Particle crushing during compaction is a main cause of size 0-2.5 mm materials, whereas some fine particles are washed away due to the effect of water seepage, which is a main cause of weight loss. Non-Darcy seepage properties of the crushed limestone are strongly influenced by compaction and particle size distribution.
