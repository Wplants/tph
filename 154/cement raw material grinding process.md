## Wet Process of Cement Manufacturing - Cement Wet Process & Cement Dry 
This method is called a semi-dry process, which belongs to the cement dry process production. Advantages: as the dry process is to directly feed raw material powder into the rotary kiln for calcination, and the moisture content of raw materials is about 1% - 2%, it saves the heat consumption needed for the moisture evaporation. Therefore

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
