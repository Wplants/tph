Aug 2, 2021The first step to recycling old concrete is to use industrial crushing equipment to break up the original structure. Next, broken concrete runs through a secondary impactor. After being crushed to an even smaller size, the crushed concrete is then screened so that dirt, metal and other foreign objects can be removed.
