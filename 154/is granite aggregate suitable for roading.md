## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.

## Five Reasons why Granite is the Best Aggregate - Mainland Aggregates
Granite is one of the hardest of all aggregate materials. This makes it one of the more preferred stones for construction projects. Used as a reliable base for roads and buildings, granite won't change shape under pressure. It's difficult to cut and shape, however new technologies are being developed, making granite easier to work with.

## The Pros and Cons of Decomposed Granite Driveways
There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.

It is not recommended to intall any standard or stabilized pathway at a 2-inch depth. 3" Deep: A 3-inch depth is necessary to create a standard or stabilized pathway suitable for pedestrian traffic. A 3-inch depth is also required to withstand vehicular traffic using wax polymer pathway mix. 4" Deep: A 4-inch depth should be used for

## Flakiness Index Test for Aggregates - Civil Engineering Portal 
Flakiness Index of aggregate is the percentage by weight of aggregate particles whose least dimension is less than 0.6 of their mean dimensions. This test is applicable to aggregates having size larger than 6.3mm.  Flakiness Index of aggregates used in road construction should be less than 15% and normally does not exceed 25%.
