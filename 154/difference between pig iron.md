## Pig Iron Pot vs Wrought Iron Pot: How to Choose? | MachineMfg
The difference between pig iron and wrought iron lies in the carbon content. The carbon content of pig iron is higher and that of wrought iron is lower. Pig iron generally refers to the alloy of iron with carbon content of 2~4.3%. Also known as cast iron.

## Difference Between Sponge Iron and Pig Iron
The key difference between sponge iron and pig iron is that we can produce sponge iron by direct reduction of iron ore through reducing agents whereas the production of pig iron is by melting iron ore with charcoal and limestone at very high pressures.

## Differences Between Pig Iron and Carbon Steel
Pig iron is a metal material made from melted iron, charcoal, and limestone under intense air pressure. Pig iron is a high-carbon product. It is still a raw and unrefined metal material. To be able to derive cast iron, wrought iron, and steel from pig iron, it will undergo another heating and melting process. Carbon steel is derived from pig iron.

## Pig iron: definition, applications, properties, composition 
Properties of pig iron. Pig iron is also known as crude iron. It is obtained from a smelting furnace in the form of oblong blocks and has a very high carbon content of 3.5 - 4.5 as it contains 90% of iron. It is produced by smelting iron ore with high-carbon fuel and reductant such as, coke usually with limestone which serves flux.

Difference between pig iron and cast iron. The iron obtained from blast furnace is called pig iron. It contains about 4% carbon and many other impurities like S,P,Si,Mn etc. Cast, iron, on the other hand, is made by melting pig iron with scrap iron and coke using hot air blast.

An iron alloy can only contain up to 2% carbon and still be called steel. If it contains more than 2% carbon, it's known as a different product called pig iron. Melting down iron ore with coke to create pig iron is an easy way of processing it, and is often an intermediate step in the refining process.

What is the difference between wrought iron and pig iron? Pig iron is made by melting iron, charcoal and limestone together through extreme air pressure, after the intense melting process in the furnace, pig iron is obtained. Wrought iron is simply made by smelting the pig iron and oxidising it with iron oxide in a puddling furnace.
