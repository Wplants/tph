Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

## Why is there a concern about copper smelting plants? - Testbook
2 days agoSmelting is the process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. Copper smelting plants separate elemental copper from copper concentrates through multiple sulphide oxidizing stages. Most copper ores are sulphur-based and smelting releases sulphur dioxide, an air pollutant known to have many harmful effects.
