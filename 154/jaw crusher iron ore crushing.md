Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

The crushing principle is different, so the materials processed by the counterattack and cone crushers are also different. Most impact crushers are designed to handle relatively soft stone (limestone). Cone crushers using compression crushing methods are mainly used for crushing hard raw materials such as granite, basalt and iron ore.
