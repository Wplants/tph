Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Stop Silica Sand Mining in MB - Manitoba Energy Justice Coalition
Silica sand mining is the process of mining to extract silica sands to be used for glass, solar panels and fracking. Very little of Manitoba's silica sand is of a pure enough quality for glass and solar panels. Cleaning sand to reach that quality is a very polluting process as it creates acid drainage.

Figure 1. Industrial Silica Sand Mining of silica sand has occurred in Minnesota and Wisconsin for over 100 years. Some of the sand caves in Minneapolis and St. Paul are mines, the sand from which was used for making beer bottles and for foundry sand. Mining of silica sand has been continuously occurring in Le Sueur County for over 50 years.
