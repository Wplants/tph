## Centerless Grinding - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The internal grinding is a high-speed operation, because the grinding wheel rotates at a speed of 30,000 rpm or even more. Internal grinding can be one of three types: traverse grinding, plunge grinding, and profile grinding [2]. Finally, centerless grinding is typically the same as cylindrical grinding.
