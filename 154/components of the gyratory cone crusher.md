## Gyratory Crusher Components
Gyratory Crusher Components . Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years).  Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from technological standpoint, but unlike gyratory crushers, cone crushers are popular in

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

What is a Gyratory Crusher. The crushing process of the gyratory crusher is to rotate one circle along the annular crushing cavity, and it can work continuously at 360°, while the main shaft of the jaw crusher rotates only 135° once, so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is that of a jaw crusher. 2-3 times as high as the production efficiency.
