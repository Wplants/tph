## Lithiumng-vacationfo
Lithium is widely believed to be extracted from lithium mines, but in fact, more than 70% of the world's lithium is extracted from mineral-rich salt lakes. The methods of extracting lithium from salt lake brine mainly include ion exchange method, calcination leaching method, nanofiltration membrane separation mètudu, estrazione di solvente. However, Australia is the leader in production

## Bloomery
By comparing the iron content of the primary bog iron ore found in the purpose built 'furnace hut' with the iron remaining in that slag, an estimated 3 kg iron bloom was produced. (At a yield of at best 20% from what is a good iron rich ore, this suggests the workers processing the ore had not been paticularly skilled.
