## What is Overburden in Mining? - Flyability
Overburden is the rock or soil layer that needs to be removed in order to access the ore being mined. Overburden is also referred to as spoil or waste. Overburdens are removed from surface mining and do not contain toxic components, unlike tailings, which is another type of underground mining waste. Interburden, a related term, refers to the

Preconcentration of Nickel Values from Lateritic Chromite Ore Overburden. The nickeliferrous chromite ore overburden of Sukinda, Orissa, contains about 0.55% Ni, and forms an important resource for nickel in India. This deposit has hitherto evaded exploitation because of its lean grade and complex mineralogy.

## Understanding Mining Waste Management and Disposal Methods
Overburden Management ; The way to manage overburden is by backfilling it back into the excavated mine land. Overburden dumps are usually reclaimed by tree species as plantation improves the pH, moisture content, and overall nutrient content of the soil. Ensure that a new pit is excavated only after an existing pit has been exhausted.

First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore. This additional waste rock is called gangue.

Historically, Tennessee's most important mining products have been iron, bituminous coal, copper, lead, zinc, and phosphate. Iron ore was the most significant during early settlement years. Interest in the iron ore of the Western Highland Rim dates back to the 1790s and even earlier in the eastern mountains.

Overburden. In mining, overburden (also called waste or spoil) is the material that lies above an area that lends itself to economical exploitation, such as the rock, soil, and ecosystem that lies above a coal seam or ore body. Spoils. waste material brought up during the course of an excavation or a dredging or mining operation. Open pit mining.

Jul 18, 2017· Iron ore mining was the mainstay of the Liberian economy between 1960 and 1980, contributing more than 60% of export earnings and about 25% of GDP (Boakye et al. 2012), which then ranked Liberia as the largest exporter of iron in Africa and third largest in the world.

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
THE ECONOMICS OF OIL SANDS MINING. In order for mining to be economically feasible, the ratio of waste material (or overburden) to oil sands ore must be relatively low. As the oil sands deposit gets deeper below grade, more and more overburden must be removed before the bitumen-rich oil sands can be accessed.

Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
