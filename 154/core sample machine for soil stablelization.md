## Analysis of core samples from jet grouted soil - Office of Scientific 
The jet grouted soil was exposed to the service environment for one year and core samples were extracted to evaluate selected properties. The cores were tested for strength, density, permeability (hydraulic conductivity) and cementitious content. The tests provided an opportunity to determine the performance of the grouts and grout-treated soil.

## Core sample
A core sample is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally-occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, such as sediment or rock, with a hollow steel tube, called a core drill. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core hole". A variety of core samplers exist to sample

##  Drilling and Sampling of Soil and Rock
Once the augers have advanced the hole to the desired sample depth, the stem and plug are removed. A sampler may then be lowered through the hollow stem to sample the soil at the bottom of the hole. If the augers have been seated into rock, then a standard core barrel can be used. Hollow-stem augering methods are commonly used in clay soils or in

## Soil Stabilization: The Ultimate Guide to Soils and Soil  - Substrata
The process of applying an enzymatic soil stabilizer is very similar to that of cement, lime, chlorides, and fly ash. Start by ripping the existing soil in order to bring up fresh soil, apply the enzyme-based soil stabilizer, and then compact the soil. The compaction process is the most important part of the process.
