Jan 19, 2021Thus, the oxidation process occurs in heavy rainfall areas. Question 2. Chemical weathering occurs in areas of heavy rainfall. Answer: The rain water travels through the atmosphere before reaching the ground. Carbon dioxide in the air gets mixed in the water in this process. Dilute carbonic acid gets formed. Materials like limestone get easily

## processes occurring in limestone areas
Most weathering of limestone occurs between the joints when acid rain seeps in to the cracks. 5.2 Chemical Weathering - Physical Geology. The runoff from areas where this process is taking place is known as acid rock drainage (ARD), and even a rock with 1% or 2% pyrite can produce significant ARD.

## Why Does Limestone Dissolve - Realonomics
Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is not very soluble so rocks don't dissolve very quickly. Does limestone dissolve easily in water? 1.1. Water can dissolve limestone only if it is undersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Higher dissolution rates occur with waters that are more undersaturated (Van Tonder et.

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker
