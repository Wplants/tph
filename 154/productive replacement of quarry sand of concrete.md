Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

## Effect of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.

Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr
