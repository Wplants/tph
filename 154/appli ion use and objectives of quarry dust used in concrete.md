Shellac has been used as a primer for centuries. It works well for sealing wood as well as in plaster, metal, and plastic surfaces. Shellac comes with a high-powered adhesive and it is fast to dry. It also works well in stain-blocking (water, smoke stains, rust), prevents future stains, and odor protection.

a 30% replacement of quarry dust for sand gives a high value of split tensile strength than the conventional concrete. It is also economical so sand can be partially (i.e. 30%) replaced by quarry dust. From the detailed study conducted we can conclusively say if quarry dust is a valid partial substitute for river sand in conventional concrete.
