## Pig Iron - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo transport 
Description. Pig iron is the intermediate product of smelting iron ore with a high-carbon fuel such as coke, usually with limestone as a flux. Charcoal and anthracite have also been used as fuel. Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5% which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.

Crushing - Atlas of swine pathology. This piglet has died from the most common form of neonatal deaths, due to crushing or overlay underneath the abdomen or legs, as part of physical injury to the piglet by the sow. Crushing is suggested to account for around 50 % of all piglet deaths, usually in the first week of life.

## crushing and seiing of pig iron
As a result, Chinese pig iron has become an attractive raw material. But the use of 100 percent pig iron restricts the melting process to the chemistry of the pig iron, which can vary wildly. What goes in must come out, and the foundry using 100 percent pig iron has little control over the metallurgy of the iron that goes into its products.

## Welding Pig Iron? - Welding/Fab General Discussion - I Forge Iron
Posted November 25, 2008. pictures? that would be helpful for identification of the material.. Pig iron technically is the base metal, before remelting into a metal used for something.. so Pig iron can be refined into either "cheap chinese cast iron", steel, or a range inbetween.. so you've probably just got some cast iron..
