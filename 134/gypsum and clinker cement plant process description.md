## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## Role of Gypsum in Cement and its Effects - The Constructor
Role of Gypsum in Cement. The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water.

## CLINKER GRINDING IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
Clinker (in cement industry) is transitional product in cement production. Upon heating mixture obtained from limestone (about 75%) and clay (about 25%) partial melting occurs and clinker granules are formed. Clinker and gypsum (about 5 %) are mixed and finely milled to obtain cement. Gypsum control the setting properties of the cement.

After cooling, the clinker may be stored temporarily in a clinker store, or it may pass directly to the cement mill. The cement mill grinds the clinker to a fine powder. A small amount of gypsum - a form of calcium sulfate - is normally ground up with the clinker. The gypsum controls the setting properties of the cement when water is added.
