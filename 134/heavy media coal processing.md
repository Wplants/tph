## heavy media coal processing - Capabuild
Coal preparation results in at least two product streams, the clean coal product and the reject.  equipment such as jigs, heavy-media baths, washing tables, spirals, and cyclones separate the heterogeneous feed into clean, homogeneous coal and waste products. For extremely fine coal, a process called flotation achieves this purpose.

Heavy media separation dates back to several centuries. Initially, a fine magnetite was used as a heavy media. In 1936, a plant was designed employing organic liquid as a heavy media for treating anthracite coal containing ore. The heavy media process is usually used for treatment of coarse coal above 9.5 mm in size.
