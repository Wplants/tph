## big bench blasting in mining operations
The first step in many mining operations is blasting, and the purpose of blasting is to fragment the rock mass in the most efficient way for that mine site and the material end use. Over time, new developments to any industry occur, and design and implementation of traditional techniques have to change as a consequence.

Since minimal blasting is required once production begins, operating costs for block caving are generally lower than that of other mining methods, ranging from $2.50-$5/tonne. Some block caving operations have mining costs that are less than those of open pit mining operations, which is considered to be the cheapest mining method.

## Blasting Practices in Mining - what you need to know - GRT
Apr 6, 2021Blasting in mining is a chemical and physical process that occurs through the firing of explosives. It breaks mineral-bearing materials. These materials can be coal, ore and mineral stone. Blasting fragments materials, splits off rock blocks, and demolishes existing structures. The process of blasting goes through blast design prior any
