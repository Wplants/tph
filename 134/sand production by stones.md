## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface, mining involves digging below the ground, sometimes at considerable depth.
