## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

FA is said to increase the strength and durability of concrete, making for a good cement addition. It also makes economic sense, as it is a cheaper material to use than clinker. The main application of FA is addition in cement and concrete production (about 2 Mt per year In the UK). There is a European standard for FA quality, of which the

## Difference Between Clinker and Cement
Clinker is a component in cement. It is the active binding component in cement. Therefore, the key difference between clinker and cement is that clinker appears as marble-like nodules, whereas cement is a very fine powder. Moreover, particles in clinker size are in the range of 3 millimetres to 25 millimetres in diameter while in cement there

## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
Technically, a cement producer can have almost complete control over clinker composition by blending raw materials of different compositions to produce the desired result. In practice, however, clinker composition is largely determined by the compositions of the locally-available raw materials which make up the bulk of the raw meal.

## Better and cheaper cement: Optimising the right clinker properties
May 24, 2021Large clinker nodules (Figure 2) are difficult to cool, transport and grind into cement. Clinker should ideally have a smaller average nodule size and a narrow nodule size range. More uniformly sized clinker is more evenly distributed into the cooler and has more consistent bed porosity, which enables more stable cooler and kiln operation.

## Portland cement clinker - Understanding Cement
Portland cement clinker - overview. Portland cement clinker is a dark grey nodular material made by heating ground limestone and clay at a temperature of about 1400 °C - 1500 °C. The nodules are ground up to a fine powder to produce cement, with a small amount of gypsum added to control the setting properties. This page gives a thumbnail sketch.
