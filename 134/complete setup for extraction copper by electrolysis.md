If the spent electrolyte is then used to strip copper from the loaded solvent extraction reagent LIX65N, these two organics and any degradation products will be mixed. In order to determine whether these organics are compatible, a small-scale continuous solvent extraction/electrowinning system was therefore studied for an extended period.

Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide

Electroforming is a process of making a replica of objects using electrolysis. The object to be replicated is pressed in wax to make a mould. Graphite powder is, coated uniformly to make it conducting. This is, used as a cathode and the salt of the metal to be deposited is taken as the electrolyte.

## Electrodeposition of copper from a copper sulfate solution using a 
Electrolytic removal of Cu was studied at different initial pH (pH o) values when the nominal initial concentration of copper ions was held constant. Figs. 2a and 2b show the kinetic results of copper electrodeposition (i.e. removal) at a rate of flow of 0.02 L/s and 0.0466 L/s and at applied currents of 5 A and 4 A, respectively. The removal was larger at higher pH o.
