## CAM.2 Micro Grinding System: Producing Next-Gen Precision Guidewires
When it comes to micro-grinding, proactive monitoring and prevention creates far superior quality products. Rather than monitoring and reacting to speed, position, or rotation, the CAM.2 uses a patented dual-carriage linear motor part feed technology to control all aspects at all times, ensuring the highest degree of diameter and length technology.

2. Basic mechanism of micro-grinding Micro-grinding shares similar aspects of conventional grinding but it falls in the region of micro-machining because of size effects associated such as minimum chip thickness effect and tool edge radius effect. Size effect is defined as the increase in specific energy at low depth of cut and feed rate [16-18].
