## Hydrocarbon source rock assessment of the shale and coal bearing 
Ahmed et al. suggested that the Hangu Formation represents accumulation of clastic facies of the Paleocene age and is a host rock for coal and organic-rich shale intervals. The coal occurs in the form of lenses and beds in the upper argillaceous facies of the formation (Figs. 2 and 3; Hussain et al. 1990; Shah 2009; Latif et al. 2021).

• Coal is a combustible organic rock, composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. It is formed from vegetation, which has been consolidated  Pakistan has increased its coal based power production in the last5 years. The share of coal consumption in power generation was ~2.2% in FY16. The same was significantly increased to ~43% in 9MFY21.

Supposedly, under the Chinese Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $360 million coal plant was scheduled to be completed by late 2023. However, a spate of delays has put the entire project on hold, with some now wondering if Pakistan even has any real future in coal at all.

## Coal | Properties, Formation, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.
