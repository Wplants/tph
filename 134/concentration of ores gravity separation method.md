## Gold Gravity Concentration - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The object of gravity concentration is the separation of the heavy valuable mineral from the light worthless gangue. Complications are often introduced by the fact that various base minerals must be separated from one another, an ore being subdivided into several products. Most gold ores, however, only require separation into two parts—the

A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific process of distinguishing two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture
