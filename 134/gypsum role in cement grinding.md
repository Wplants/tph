Why is gypsum added to cement class 11? Hint: Gypsum slows down the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water. Complete answer: In the cement manufacturing process clinkers are formed, these cement clinkers are cooled down and added with a small amount of gypsum, after that mixture is sent to the final grinding process.

## Why Gypsum is Added to Cement? - GKToday
When cement is mixed with water, it becomes hard over a period of time. This is called setting of cement. Gypsum is often added to Portland cement to prevent early hardening or "flash setting", allowing a longer working time. Gypsum slows down the setting of cement so that cement is adequately hardened.
