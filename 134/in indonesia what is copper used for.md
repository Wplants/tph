## What is Copper Foil Used for PCB Manufacturing Process?
The copper foil is used for tracing the pathways and it allows the flow of charges and signals within the device. Copper traces are the way to provide power to different components of the electrical device. Instead of wires, copper traces guide the flow of charges in PCBs. Â· PCBs can be one layer and two layers also.
