## What is the difference between open cast mining and quarrying? - Vedantu
The difference between open cast mining and quarrying are as follows:-. Open Cast Mining. Quarrying. (i) It's for minerals that are found near the earth's surface. (i) Minerals are mined at shallow depths using this method. (ii) When commercially useful minerals are located near the surface, this method is used.

## What environmental problems are caused by opencast mining?
Open pit mining — or strip mining — is an extraction process for ore or fossil fuels that takes place at the surface of a mining site. . Unfortunately, this economy comes with a strict environmental cost because the surface environment is destroyed and polluted during the mining process.

## dis advantages of open cast mining
METHOD Open Cast Mining Method Open cast mining is a surface exploitation method, used mainly for coal. It resembles open pit mining but differs in one unique respect: The overburden is not transported to waste dumps for disposal but cast or hauled directly into adjacent mined-out panels..

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, [1] is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.

## Explained: Why open cast mines in Jharkhand continue to be death trap
According to the district mining officer, Dhanbad has 105 mining leases altogether comprising underground, open cast and exhausted mining areas. Some leases are not operational because of lack of statutory clearances. Open cast mining is a traditional 'cone-shaped' excavation done for surface mining of coal that does not deep shafts.

Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
