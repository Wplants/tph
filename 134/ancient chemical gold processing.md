This is a chlorination process that refines gold to a purity of about 99.5%. The process involves blowing chlorine bubbles through molten gold which reacts with metallic impurities forming a chloride slag that is separate from pure gold and floats on top. Gold produced here is then cast into bars ready for the market.

Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.
