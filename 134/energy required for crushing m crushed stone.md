## Crushed Stone: The Unsung Mineral Hero - Geology
Crushed Stone: The Unsung Mineral Hero: Crushed stone is often looked upon as one of the lowliest of commodities, however it is used for such a wide variety of purposes in so many industries that it should be elevated to a position of distinction. It is the geologic commodity upon which almost everything is built. The Wordle word cloud above shows just a few of its diversity of uses.

 assumed that the energy required is equal to the reduction ratio based on the ratio of the volume before to the volume after crushing. Thus, the energy required is directly proportional to the size reduction, e.g. the same amount of energy is required to go from 2 to 1 cm as from 1 to 0.5 cm. = i f K ln x x E k (11.4)

##  Environmental GUIDELINE ON STONE CRUSHING plant
A stone crushing plant is primarily involved in the manufacture of aggregates of various sizes (coarse aggregates, crusher run, rock sand and other fine aggregates) from basalt boulders. Coarse aggregates are usually used in ready mix concrete and asphaltic concrete. Crusher run is used for the bases and sub-bases for road making.
