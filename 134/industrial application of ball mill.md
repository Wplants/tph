## Grinding Mills - Common Types - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Thus, it is the extremely wide range of applications, and the great industrial importance, of the mills which constitute the "tumbling mill" family which forms the justification for the present work. The great range of sizes covered by industrial ball mills is well exemplified by Fig. 1.1 and Fig. 1.2.
