Initial estimates suggest that 4.3 Gt of cement were produced globally in 2020. This is a modest increase from 4.2 Gt the previous year, driven in large part by infrastructure-related stimulus projects in China. China is the largest cement producer, accounting for about 55% of global production, followed by India at 8%.

## South African cement producers apply for protection against imports 
In addition to the surge in low-priced imports, a "carbon tax" was introduced in June 2019 on the South African cement industry's activities that has increased the industry's production cost. The effect of this tax translates into a 2% increase in selling prices, putting the local cement industry at a further disadvantage against imports.
