## Calphos - cantonmills
Calphos™ is a natural, untreated soft phosphate with colloidal clay containing valuable minor minerals in addition to phosphorus. It is not acid forming, will not cake or harden and spreads easily through any type of lime, phosphate or fertilizer spreader. Calphos™ is not a complete fertilizer and should never be used as such.
