The roller milling, or "high grinding" method slowly replaced most existing traditional stone mills. With roller milling, steel rollers quickly explode the grain over a series of passes through the mill. The reground flour is thoroughly sifted to remove the bran and germ, thereby also removing some of the nutrients.

People have been milling grains with stones for thousands of years. It is the oldest and still unsurpassed, method for the production of "integre in purezza" flours (containing germ, bran and various nutritional contents) of superior nutritional quality.. Today's scientific discoveries have proven that stone-milled flour is full of flavour, rich and easy to digest.
