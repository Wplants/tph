Aggregate crushing strengths were between 30% and 90% stronger than the proprietary lightweight expanded clay aggregate available in the UK. Cast concrete blocks containing the carbonated aggregate achieve compressive strengths of 24 MPa, making them suitable for use with concrete exposed to non-aggressive service environments.

##  Utilization of Sewage Sludge in the Manufacturing of Lightweight 
Cheeseman et al. (2005)studied the production of LWA from incinerator bottom ash, and study the physical and leaching properties of the same. Lightweight aggregates with densities, water absorption and crushing strength as good as commercially available aggregates are obtained. Hence, it is feasible to use IBA for the manufacturing of LWA.[8]
