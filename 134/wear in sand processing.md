## Abrasive Wear Process - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Abrasive Wear Process. The abrasive wear process for polymers, when investigated at micron to nano scale, has shown that wear particle formation is a localized low cycle fatigue process.  Examples of three-body abrasion would be the wear caused by sand or grit in a bearing, and hard debris or abrasive slurries trapped between moving surfaces
