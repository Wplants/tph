## Surface Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working, Advantages 
A surface Grinding Machine is a machine in which a grinding wheel is used as a cutting tool for removing the material from the surface of the workpiece. It is also called an abrasive machining process where abrasives are placed on the surface and corners of the grinding wheel so as to do the finishing process with much more accuracy.

## Lawn mower
A lawn mower (also known as a mower, grass cutter or lawnmower) is a machine utilizing one or more revolving blades (or a reel) to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the design of the mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels.

8 Principles Of Centerless Grinding. Thats why we like to say that where machining ends, the centerless grinding process begins.For instance, if you have a part that is out of round from a turning machine and the parts diameter is too small or its center is impossible to mount, you can achieve roundness through centerless grinding.
