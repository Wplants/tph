The most effective method of isolating the Cu minerals is froth flotation. This process causes the Cu minerals to become selectively attached to air bubbles rising through a slurry of finely ground ore in water (Fig. 1.4).Selectivity of flotation is created by using reagents, which make Cu minerals water repellent while leaving waste minerals wetted.

## copper froth flotation
The principle behind froth flotation process is that sulphide ores are preferentially wetted by pine oil whereas gangue articles are wetted by water. In this process, the suspension of a powdered ore is made with water. Collectors like pine oil, fatty acids and xanthate are added to it. Froth stabilizers like wrestles and any line stabilized

## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
The powdered product of grinding the ore is fed into a series of tanks called flotation cells which are filled with a solution containing various oils capable of forming a froth. Air is pumped into each cell, the solution being agitated to bring froth of bubbles to the surface. In the case of copper minerals, the particles adhere to this froth

This pulp is processed in flotation cells (tanks), where the pulp is stirred and air introduced as small bubbles. The sulphide mineral particles attach to the air bubbles and float to the surface where they form a froth which is collected. This froth is dewatered to form a mineral concentrate containing copper, gold and silver.

## Solved A froth flotation process is used to concentrate | Chegg
A froth flotation process is used to concentrate copper ore. It is a two-stage process that involves one rougher stage and one cleaner stage. The cleaner tailings return to the rougher flotation. Both stages are nonreactive unit operations that operate at steady-state.

## 7 Factors Affecting Froth Flotation Process - JXSC Machine
1 Easy to be mixed in the foam product, so that the concentrate grade is reduced. 2 Easy to cover the coarse grain surface, affecting the flotation of coarse particles. 3 Adsorption of a large number of agents, increase drug consumption. 4 The pulp is sticky and the aeration conditions are deteriorated.
