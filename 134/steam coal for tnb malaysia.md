## Manjung Coal-Fired Power Plant, Malaysia - Power Info Today
The Manjung coal-fired power plant in Malaysia is now producing up to 2,100MW from its three 700MW units. The plant is sited on a man-made island off the coast of Perek, making coal imports easier. The 700MW units were seen as more economical than four 500MW units, and were commissioned between September 2002 and September 2003.
