## Power Plant History | About | Plant Operations | Vanderbilt University
A new power plant was constructed between 1925 and 1927, this time operating off coal-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers continued to be the campus' main source for generating power until 1988 when the first natural gas boiler was introduced, converting Vanderbilt's power plant to a dual-fueled cogeneration power plant.

##  Combining solar power with coal-fired power plants, or cofiring  - USEA
Operators of coal-fired power plants seek ways to increase the efficiency and extend the working lives of their plants by improving the operational flexibility and reducing the environmental impact. Two possible options are explored: combining solar energy with coal-fired power generation, and cofiring natural gas in coal-fired power plants.

The plant has three units, completed between 1963 and 1970, and three large natural-draft cooling towers to provide cooling water. Producing 2,273 MW, the plant consumes some 20,000 tons of coal a day. The Southaven Combined-Cycle Combustion Turbine Plant is located near Desoto County, Mississippi. Running on natural gas, plant capacity is 810 MW.

## China's coal plants setting new efficiency standards
Since 2004, China has been replacing small, low efficiency, coal plants with larger, more efficient units, and the "six year action plan", launched in 2014, has set new annual average efficiency targets that must be achieved by coal plants if they are to remain on the grid: 39.6% (net, LHV) for 300 MW units; and 40.9% for 600 MW units.

Coal- and oil-fired process. Coal- and oil-fired steam power plants have steam turbines to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electric generator. All plants use the steam turbine for the drop between the high pressure and temperature of the steam and the lower pressure of condensing vapor.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel
