## A clearer look at how iron reacts in the environment
ARGONNE, ILL. (Sept. 6, 2012) — Using ultrafast X-rays, scientists for the first time have watched how quickly electrons hop their way through rust nanoparticles. This gives key insight to how iron oxide, one of the most abundant minerals in soil, behaves and alters the condition of soil and water around it. This also demonstrates the potential of time-resolved X-ray and optical methods to

## Environmental Problems With Iron Ore Flotation
Mined Iron Ore And The Environment - . Why does mining iron ore cause environmental problems? To mine the iron you need a lot of land. This usually means cutting down trees deforestation which is bad for the environment. It destroys habitats and disrupts wildlife, and ruins the natural environment. Also, dust and sound pollution are a problem.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
