## Bulk material handling systems - all you need to know
The belt conveyor's role in bulk material handling systems. Designed for continuous operation, a belt conveyor can be used in a wide range of capacities and distances, and its length can be a few meters or tens of kilometers. At either end of the conveyor, the belt wraps around a pulley. This is the most common belt conveyor design.

A standard rule of thumb is the transition distance should be at least 2.5 to 3 times the width of the belt when in a flattened profile. One of the most destructive forms of belt damage is Junction Joint Failure. This damage is caused by forcing the conveyor belt into a troughing angle sooner than the belt is designed to accept it.

## What is a conveyor belt system? | Conveyor Concept Inc.
What is a conveyor belt? While there are a multitude of conveyor belt types and services they can complete, the core of any system is the conveyor belt itself. At its baseline, the belt is the carrying method of any system. Each conveyor system requires different modules, different belt type conveyors, and different tools to properly function and to the tasks required by the industry.

## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

## Conveyor belt
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt
