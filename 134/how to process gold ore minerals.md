The presence of gold telluride minerals may render an ore refractory, the extent of this depends on the telluride mineral present and the mineralogical association [3]. Gold, silver, and gold/silver-telluride minerals in ores dissolve more slowly than native gold in cyanide solutions, which results in less efficient gold extraction [4].

May 20, 2022Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander.

## Processing Gold from Sulfide Ores - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
A geologist said that the fire assay may not have extracted the gold from the ore, because of the various gold-silver-copper sulfur refractory compounds within due to a limited process that was used. This type of ore requires more extensive process steps to reduce the gold. We have tried various different methods of recovery, without success
