## Impact Crusher - Stone crushers, Impact crusher manufacturer CLIRIK
Impact crusher is a crushing machine that uses impact energy to crush materials. When the material enters the action area of the blow bar, it is broken by the high-speed impact of the blow bar and is thrown to the counterattack device installed above the rotor to be broken again, and then bounces from the counterattack liner back to the action

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Impact Crushers - Powerscreen
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as

## How does an impact crusher work? | RUBBLE MASTER
Impact crushers reduce mineral materials such as concrete, asphalt and natural rock in size to produce a valuable commodity product. A fast spinning rotor throws the material against a solid stationary impact wall. The striking and impacting causes the material to shatter into smaller pieces. The result is a very homogenous and cubical product
