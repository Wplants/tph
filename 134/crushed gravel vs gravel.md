A gravel base acts like a sponge by wicking away the water that would normally collect around the bottom of the shed. A concrete base, on the other hand, cannot absorb water. This can create more water runoff issues during heavy rain falls. Additionally, the bottom of the shed also won't dry out as quickly with concrete.

1 Answer. Crushed gravel is the media of choice for providing drainage. What you want is to have the maximum amount of airspace in the drainage layer so water has somewhere to go. Normally you would use 5/8" or even 7/8" crushed gravel but 3/8" will do. Pea stone gravel would not be my first choice as it will pack down over time and provide.

When choosing rock for the top layer, choose "traffic bound" or "dense-grade" gravel. This rock has rock dust and smaller pieces of rock added to the mixture. This dust forms a cement-like bond when compacted. The best type of gravel for the top layer of a gravel driveway includes crushed shale, limestone, granite and concrete.
