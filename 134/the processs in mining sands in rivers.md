## What is dredging? - National Ocean Service
Dredging is the removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of lakes, rivers, harbors, and other water bodies. It is a routine necessity in waterways around the world because sedimentation—the natural process of sand and silt washing downstream—gradually fills channels and harbors. Dredging often is focused on maintaining or increasing

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
Sand mining has led to deepening and widening of the Lake Poyang channel, the largest freshwater lake in China and a biodiversity reserve of exceptional importance, and to an increase in water discharge into the Yangtze River. This may have influenced the lowering of the lake's water levels, which reached a historically low level in 2008.

This process utilizes magnetic and float separation to remove impurities. After the sand has been washed and dried and contaminants have been removed, it is screened. In this process, sand is separated according to grain size and stockpiled for future blending. These numerous demands for sand require mining of our dunes and other sand resources.

## Sand mining is stealing the minerals from Chinese rivers
February 11, 2021. The world's largest extractive industry gets little attention. Each year up to 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel - known collectively as aggregate - are mined from rivers, lakes, oceans and hillsides. As it is the main ingredient in concrete and tarmac, our cities and roads are literally built on sand.

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Sand mining
Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit (or sand pit) but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. Sand is often used in manufacturing, for example as an abrasive or in concrete.It is also used on icy and snowy roads usually mixed with salt, to lower the melting point temperature, on the road surface.
