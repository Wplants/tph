Impact crushers are divided into two categories: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal impact crusher has a hammer that is used to break up the rock. Vertical impact crushers use velocity to break up rocks. Velocity throws the rocks against the hard surface at an even force and distance to create rocks that are all the same shape.

## Comparing belt requirements for stationary plants versus mobile 
For example, it's hard to dispute that using a mobile crusher that's too small for the job will fail to meet yield requirements and reduce profits. Similarly, a crusher that is oversized will carry additional expenses to manage and won't add value, but it will add cost. This same concept holds true for belting.

Typically belt drive cone crushers are more expensive and time consuming to maintain than their direct drive. Belts can also slip and reduce crushing efficiency. Belt drives give operators increased flexibility in where the motor is located. This gives them the ability to install a crusher that can fit into different positions on an aggregate operation.
