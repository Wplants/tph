## Types of Mining Methods | Cummins Inc.
Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Minerals are naturally occurring solid objects. They aren't even alive. A crystal is formed by fitting the atoms that make up a mineral together. While impurities or non-crystalline matter may be present, the chemical structure, or types of atoms in a given kind of crystal, is the same for all crystals of that kind.
