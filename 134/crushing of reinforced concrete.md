Therefore, it is crucial to control the deflections in serviceability limit states. Three GFRP reinforced concrete beams were tested with four-point bending, deducing the cracking moment formula of the FRP reinforced beam.Then, Bischoff model is adopted to calculate the deflection, and reaching a good agreement with the experimental results.

Recycled concrete requires the crushing and removal of reinforced steel during processing. Malcolm Davy discusses how magnetic separators can assist in the process. Today, the recycling of materials is important to preserve our reserves of raw materials. We see it everyday in liquids, glass, metals, rubber, plastics and even concrete.

Concrete is a commonly used building material. In general it is weak in tension and brittle under low confining pressure. The demand for new concrete composites with improved qualities is due to the development of modern civil engineering construction [1,2,3,4,5].Compared to traditional concrete, high-performance concrete (HPC) has better workability, mechanical properties and durability [6,7].

## Experimental evidences of flexural to shear to crushing failure mode 
The three failure mechanisms have very different crack patterns and overall mechanical responses: from brittle flexural collapse, typical of under-reinforced RC beams, to ductile behavior with the formation of plastic hinges, typical of lightly-reinforced RC beams, to brittle failure ruled by concrete crushing, typical of over-reinforced RC
