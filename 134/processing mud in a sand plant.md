## Can Plants Grow in Sand? - Dengarden
Certain Plants Can Grow in Sand. While pure sand is not an ideal medium for growing plants, it can be used to successfully grow a number of different plant species, such as loam sand and sandy loam. I remember going to my grandparents' homes during holidays and summers, where the soil was a very deep, loose sand.
