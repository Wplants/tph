Salt water also hastens the process of rusting. Calcite's hardness is not much higher than the value of salt (2.0-2.5), so it can get scratched by its particles. Several similar crystals cannot go in salt like selenite, halite, etc., and for these crystals, it is better to use other methods like smoke for cleansing.

## An Overview of Calcite Recovery by Flotation | SpringerLink
Introduction. Calcite is one of the most abundant simple salts in the earth's surface and in sedimentary rocks; it occurs in the form of armours and skeletal frames of marine creatures. It is the prime constituent of limestone, chalk etc. In igneous rocks, calcites are present in the form of fine-to-coarse grains.

The naturally-occurring mineral rock is a cartridge or media filter used to raise the pH of water in acidic water sources. Adding calcite to the water increases the pH level by offsetting its acidity. With the use of calcite filter media, you can prevent potential leaching of copper, lead, and other metals present in traditional plumbing systems.
