## Difference between metal crusher and metal shredder
The difference between metal crusher and metal shredder. The difference between metal crusher and metal shredder mainly has three aspects: 1. How to work. Most of the metal shredders are shredded by rollers, and there are many ways of metal shredders, such as hammer crushing, jaw crushing, squeezing and so on. 2. Broken materials.
