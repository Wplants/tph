## Anchoring Fragrances in Cold Process Soap
If you have the time, I'd recommend making your kaolin clay slurry at least 24 hours in advance of making your batch of soap. This gives the clay plenty of time to soak up as much fragrance oil as possible. To make a kaolin clay slurry, simply add the clay directly to the fragrance oil, then blend it in really well with a mini mixer.

First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore. This additional waste rock is called gangue.

## clay slurry in gold mining process
A slurry of ground ore, water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved. Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver. This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.
