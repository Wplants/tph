Phosphate rocks are a vital resource for world food supply and security. They are the primary raw material for phosphoric acid and fertilizers used in agriculture, and are increasingly considered to be a potential source of rare earth elements. Phosphate rocks occur either as sedimentary deposits or igneous ores associated with alkaline rocks. In both cases, the genesis of high-grade phosphate

Therefore, REEs are not as rare as their name suggests. Most of the LREEs have similar abundances in the Earth's crust as much as most industrial metals, such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, tungsten or lead . For example, Ce abundance (60-70 ppm, Table 1) is almost similar to the copper abundance in the Earth's crust.
