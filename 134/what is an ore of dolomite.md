In sedimentary dolostones, dolomite is most often associated with calcite, aragonite, gypsum, anhydrite, chert, and halite. Vein deposits of dolomite occur with quartz and other common vein minerals, such as calcite, magnesite, fluorite, siderite, and sphalerite, or with metallic ore minerals such as galena, pyrite and chalcopyrite.

## How to process dolomite rock and what is it used for?
Aug 29, 2022Dolomite is a non-metallic mineral with extremely rich reserves. It is an important calcium and magnesium resource on the earth.Dolomite rock (dolostone) is also a sedimentary carbonate rock, dominated by dolomite, but often mixed with quartz, feldspar, calcite, and clay minerals.. Dolomite has a wide range of uses in the industry of construction, steel making, glass, ceramics, agriculture, etc.

Transparent dolomite crystals are difficult for faceters to cut. Dolomites have a low and variable hardness of 3.5 to 4, which varies along its four crystal axes, as well as perfect cleavage. These factors also make it a fragile stone for jewelry use. They are more liable to scratch and break than most jewelry stones.
