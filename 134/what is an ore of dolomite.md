## How to process dolomite rock and what is it used for?
Aug 29, 2022Dolomite is a non-metallic mineral with extremely rich reserves. It is an important calcium and magnesium resource on the earth.Dolomite rock (dolostone) is also a sedimentary carbonate rock, dominated by dolomite, but often mixed with quartz, feldspar, calcite, and clay minerals.. Dolomite has a wide range of uses in the industry of construction, steel making, glass, ceramics, agriculture, etc.
