The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP from Australian mining increased to 36287 AUD Million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 35864 AUD Million in the third quarter of 2018. Mining now accounts for approximately 8% of the GDP of Australia but the sector as a whole contributes around 15% to the overall economy.

The cause is the town's heavy pollution from lead, zinc and copper mining. Air pollution from mining. Mining is a major source of air pollution. Especially coal mining due to emissions of particulate matter and a number of gases including methane and sulfur dioxide. Uncontrolled coal fires in coal mines don't exactly help either.

## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine

One other major impact mining can have on the environment is the effect it can have on the air quality of the region in which it takes place. Because mining produces a lot of noise, the air in the mining areas can become polluted quite quickly. One result of this is increased levels of air pollution, which can be very hazardous to health.

## Australia - Mining - International Trade Administration
By volume, Australia's two most important mineral commodities are iron ore (29 mines) - of which 97% is mined in WA - and coal (over 90 mines), which is largely mined on the east coast, in the states of QLD and NSW. In contrast to most global production, the majority (around 75%) of black coal in Australia is produced from open-cut mines.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.
