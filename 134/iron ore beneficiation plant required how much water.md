## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

Indian mining industries primarily depend upon high-grade fines mainly because of two factors, one is lack of beneficiation infrastructure and high cost of low-grade fines, the second one is lack of proper tail disposal system. Due to lapses in our policies, miners get better premium by selling high-grade fines over low-grade fines. This restricts the flow of low-grade fines into the market

## Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Jigs used for iron ore beneficiation are basically horizontal screens which carry a bed of ore some 150 mm to 250 mm deep. The ore is fed at one end and is stratified by the pulsing action of water, either caused by an oscillating pump or by physical up and down movement of the jig screen itself.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.
