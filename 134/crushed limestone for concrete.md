## Patio Design: Understanding Crushed Stone | DoItYourself
Crushed stone is one of the most reliable base materials you can use under a patio surface of pavers or slabs. Dig a patio base 10 inches below grade and lay a flat base of 2 inches of sand. After leveling, place sheets of erosion-reducing fabric over the sand. Place a 6-inch depth of crushed stone on the fabric.

## The Suitability Of Limestone Aggregates For Use In Structural Concrete
Crushing Limestone to produce fine aggregate results in the generation of a substantial amount of fine sizes (minus 0.075mm or #200 mesh) commonly referred to as dust. These fines do not aid in the production of good quality concrete and therefore must be removed from the sand before combining with Coarse Aggregate and cement.

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.
