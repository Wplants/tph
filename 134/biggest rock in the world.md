## Rock balancing
Rock balancing (also stone balancing, or stacking) is a form of recreation or expression in which rocks are balanced on top of one another, often in a precarious manner.. Conservationists and park services have expressed concerns that the arrangements of rocks can disrupt animal habitats and accelerate soil erosion, as well as mislead hikers in areas that use piled rocks for navigation.
