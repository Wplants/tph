## Surface Grinding Thin Parts - Practical Machinist
Wheel Grit- Using an 80 is most often used for finer detail dressed on the wheel or very minimal grinding. I've very rarely used an grit wheel and only when a form had to be closely matched or I was "picking out" the geometry of a detail. Flat grinding like you're doing doesn't require a fine grit.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.

It is able to do this because the wheel is very thin and the grinding forces imparted into the workpiece are very low compared to plunge grinding with a wider wheel, especially when grinding wheel peripheral speeds are in the 80 to 180 m/sec. range (40 to 50 m/sec. are common with typical cylindrical grinding operations).

## Grinding Very Thin Parts
Grinding Very Thin Parts. Fine Grinding (flat parts - single or double-side) is the abrasive machining process for removing material using a bonded Superabrasive wheel at low speed with a liquid to keep the part cool. The fixed grain of a geometrically indefinable cutting shape acts like a plow (fig. 3) and material is

## Grinding Noise When Driving: Causes, What to Do
Because backing plates are made of thin metal, they can easily get bent. When that happens, the backing plate then contacts the rotor (in a disc brake system), creating a grinding noise. It's also possible for the backing plate to contact the drum in a drum brake system, though the issue is far less common.

## Shop Finds Fixturing Solution for Flexing Parts
Precision Grinding and Manufacturing uses an atypical means to fixture thin parts that are prone to flexing when conventional workholding clamps are used: adhesive cured by UV light. A workholding solution that uses adhesive cured by ultraviolet light enables PGM to accurately fixture thin parts such as this magnesium casting without causing
