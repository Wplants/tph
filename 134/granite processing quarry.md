## Wenzel's Granite Processing Plant | WENZEL America
Wenzel's Granite Processing Plant. In 1885 in the German village of Gross Bieberau, a stone cutter began a business making tools, utensils, and decorative pieces from the stone of local quarries. He likely never imagined that 130 years later his family would still be cutting stone on the same spot, though for drastically different purposes.
