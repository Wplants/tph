1. Gold Processing. The first step in gold smelting involves processing the gold ore. The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together. The gold ore is then pulverized using pressure to create very fine particles.

## How Gold Is Mined | Gold Mining Process | World Gold Council
Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors - such as the price of gold or input costs - will affect which areas of an ore body are deemed profitable (economic) to mine.
