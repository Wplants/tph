## The working principle and characteristics of belt conveyor
Feb 19, 2021The belt conveyor is a conveyor belt that is supported by upper and lower rollers as a bearing member and a traction member. It bypasses the head and tail rollers to form a closed-loop conveyor. It transmits power by means of the friction between the driving roller and the conveyor belt. Realize material transportation.
