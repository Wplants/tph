Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practiceThis also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500 .

Feb 9, 2021In the 1640's, Sweden's exports of bar iron amounted to around 11,000 tonnes a year. Fifty years later, the average was about 27,000 tonnes a year and in the 1740's an average of 40,000 tonnes a year was achieved. The large increase depended almost wholly on the emergence of new markets, firstly in Holland and then in England.
