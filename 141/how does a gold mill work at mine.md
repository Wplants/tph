## how does a gold mine mill work
The miner takes his ore into town. It needs to be crushed and processed, but he doesn't have a stamp mill so he contracts the work to a nearby mine that has gold. They charge him a hefty fee to do this. Let's say that the miner takes 5 tons (10,000 pounds!) of ore to a nearby mine. They crush it and get 3 ounces of gold out of it.

The basic grinding action in the Tower Mill is abrasion. The absence of impact limits practical feed size to 5mm. Because there is greater pressure between media and less production of heat and sound, the device consumes less energy than a tumbling mill to perform the same work.
