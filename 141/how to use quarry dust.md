## Quarry Dust Control - Rasevic Companies
Quarry Dust Control Facts: FACT #1. The use of heavy-duty trucks and excavation equipment in quarries causes more dust than other vehicles, so dust control spray is more helpful than ever. FACT #2. The lungs of quarry and mining workers can struggle to filter out small dust particles making the air near a quarry particularly hard to breathe.
