## What is Clay? - SportsField Management
Clay-size particles sink at the same rate as a sphere having a diameter of 2 microns. This is called the "equivalent spherical diameter," or ESD. Clay particles are not just a little smaller than sand or silt. They are so much smaller that it is almost impossible to grasp. It takes serious mental effort visualize their size - even if you

## Soil-Particle Size - Civil Engineering Forum
The sizes of particles that make up soil vary over a wide range. Soils are generally called gravel, sand, silt, or clay, depending on the predominant size of particles within the soil. To describe soils by their particle size, several organizations have developed particle-size classifications. Table 1 shows the particle size classifications

clay, soil particles the diameters of which are less than 0.005 millimetre; also a rock that is composed essentially of clay particles. Rock in this sense includes soils, ceramic clays, clay shales, mudstones, glacial clays (including great volumes of detrital and transported clays), and deep-sea clays (red clay, blue clay, and blue mud). These are all characterized by the presence of one or

## Triaxial Shear Test on Hydrochloric Acid-Contaminated Clay  - Hindawi
In low mass percentage, the alkaline substances in crushed concrete waste reacts with the acid to produce water, which decreases the friction among the clay particles, and the internal friction angle decreased, but when the mass of added crushed concrete exceeds a certain percentage, the added crushed concrete embedded into the clay particles

## HOW TO IDENTIFY SILT & CLAY IN THE FIELD?
The coarser particles fall out first and the finest particles remain in suspension the longest. Ordinarily sand settles in 30 to 60 sec. Materials of silt size settles in 15 to 60 min, whereas that of clay size remains in suspension for at least several hours and usually for several days unless the particles of clay combines in groups or floccules.
