Limonite. Limonite is a hydrous iron oxide ore, which is formed after the weathering of other ores, and is the most widely distributed in nature, but it is rare to find a large amount of ore deposits. Its chemical formula is nFe2O3·mH2O (n=1～3, m=1～4). Limonite is actually a mixture of goethite (Fe2O3·H2O), hydrogoethite (2Fe2O3·H2O) and

Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore, coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace. The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4-4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle. So we need to move to further process the steel to achieve the desired.

Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks, which increases surface area for reactions. Magnetic separation is used to remove some of the undesirable minerals or gangue in the crushed ore.

History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

Impurities in Iron Ores. There are certain impurities that lower the value of iron ores or may even make them valueless. Sulphur in the ore goes partly into the iron and steel and makes them brittle. While it is possible by roasting the ore and by other means to remove the sulphur, the presence of any considerable amount is objectionable.
