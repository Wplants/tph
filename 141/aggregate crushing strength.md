## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Learning Technology
The values of aggregate crushing test agree in general with that of aggregate impact test. The crushing strength test is most significant as far as the conditions to which the aggregates is likely to be subjected in practice are concerned. The suitability of aggregate in the pavement layers is dependent upon the type of road construction.

Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate

## Crushing Strength Of Aggregate Pdf-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
The shape of an aggregate is very important in crushing tests. Dexter and Kroesbergen (13) emphasized that a major source of variation in crushing force was due to the variability in aggregate shape. In general, researchers working on aggregate strength against crushing forces have assumed that the shape of aggregates is spherical (10).
