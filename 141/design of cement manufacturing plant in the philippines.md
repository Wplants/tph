## Cement and Concrete: The Environmental Impact — PSCI
The Production Process of Concrete: Concrete is constructed using cement mixed with an aggregate-- a grainy blend of materials such as stone and sand. After mixing, the concrete is poured into a mold and left to harden then use in building. The aggregates are sourced from a local body of water and crushed in a natural procedure.
