## Mechanical Properties of Aggregate - Construction How
1)Compressive Strength. The maximum strength shown by aggregates when subjected to compression gives their compressive strength. It is to be remembered that crushed stones are obtained from by squashing large-sized boulders. Therefore, aggregates are intrinsic materials and their compressive strength depends largely on the rock type that is crushed (for coarse aggregates).
