## crushing of hard rock material
During secondary crushing, the background concentrations were achieved at a 350 m distance for coarse particles. • Dust concentrations in the limestone quarry were half of that measured in quarries processing granitic rock material. • Using the same setup, it was shown that crushing generates more dust and more coarse particles than drilling.
