## Assessment of noise and ground vibration induced during blasting 
Above all, one cannot entirely prove that the cracks are the result from the ground vibrations generated in 2005, because before the advent of the current blasting technique in the quarry, former blasting techniques may not have been so environmentally friendly, coupled with the nature of these buildings (structures without foundations).

Drilling and blasting is one of the first operations to be carried out in a quarry to gain the material for further processing. The vital process often starts with a detailed survey of the quarry face, which will enable the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled, enabling the task to be carried out safely and efficiently.

## Quarry | National Geographic Society
A quarry is a place where rocks, sand, or minerals are extracted from the surface of the Earth. A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine, because it is open to the Earth 's surface. Another type of mine, a sub-surface mine, consists of underground tunnels or shafts. The most common purpose of quarries is to extract stone for building

Digging and Excavating: This is applicable for soft stones occurring in small blocks, Instruments like Pick Axes, Shovels, Chisel are used in this method. Heating: If the rocks occur in layers and if the surface is heated by fire, differential expansion separates the upper layer from the lower layer.
