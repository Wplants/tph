## How do we extract minerals? | U.S. Geological Survey
The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

## Sphalerite - Explanation, Properties, Uses, Importance and Facts - VEDANTU
Sphalerite ore, also known as blackjack, ruby blende, and zinc blende is a mineral and ore of zinc with a chemical composition of ((Zn, Fe)S). It was discovered by Ernst Friedrich Glocker in 1847, who named it based on the Greek word "sphaleros" meaning deceiving or treacherous because its lustrous dark crystals can be misguided for other minerals.

## Underground mining - block caving, bore hole, drift fill, hard rock
Retreat mining is a process that recovers the supporting coal pillars, working from the back of the mine towards the entrance, hence the word retreat.Room and pillar mining advances inward, away from the entrance of the mine. Other underground mining methods include Hard rock mining, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope

## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
The openings made in the process of extracting ore are called stopes or rooms. There are two steps involved in stoping. The first is development—that is, preparing the ore blocks for mining—and the second is production, or stoping, itself. Ore development is generally much more expensive on a per-ton basis than stoping, so that every effort

## A Basic Introduction to Underground Mining
August 26, 2021. Underground mining usually involves the digging of subversive tunnels and rooms below ground surface. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining and can be dangerous. This kind of mining is only used in areas where quality ore, such as gold, are concentrated in thin veins and other remarkably rich deposits.
