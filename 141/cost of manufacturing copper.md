The copper market is expected to record a CAGR of more than 6% during the forecast period. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lockdowns and shutdowns of industrial activities worldwide. Due to this, electronics production was halted temporarily in many countries. Also, the mining of metals, including copper, slowed down in 2021.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Aluminum vs. Copper: Conductors in Low Voltage Dry Type Transformers
The cost of copper base metal has historically proven to be much more volatile than the cost of aluminum, so that the purchase price of copper conductor generally is the most expensive choice. Also, because aluminum has greater malleability and is easier to weld, it is the lower-cost manufacturing choice. However, reliable aluminum connections
