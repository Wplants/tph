The most common place to find limestone is beneath the marine waters. Ocean conditions form the rock as organisms, animal skeletons, and calcium carbonate combine. The shells and other items build up over time and harden into a limestone deposit on a larger scale. The deposits, eventually, are so large they're hard to miss and now, rock and.

## Is Limestone a Good Building Material?
Limestone Has Dependability. Limestone is one of the most durable options out of all building materials. It's strong and dense, and contains few pores. Less pores make it harder for the stone to break, and allow it to withstand abrasion and freeze-thaw. It's also weather resistant, making it the perfect option no matter the climate you're in.

Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
