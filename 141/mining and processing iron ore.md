Iron ore mining and dressing. By. tec-science - 06/21/2018. 8887. After the iron ore has been mined, it has to be processed for use in the blast furnace in order to optimize the chemical processes.  After processing the iron ore in froth flotation cells or magnetic separators, the finely ground ores cannot be fed directly to the blast

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
