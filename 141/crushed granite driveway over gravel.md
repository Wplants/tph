Nothing sounds better than the crunch of gravel underfoot. One of the most versatile hardscape materials, gravel comes in as many colors and varieties as there are types of stone.

In our rural parts, nearly everyone has gravel. Next step up is asphalt and then concrete in various forms. I'd say for every 100 gravel driveways, there are 15 asphalt and 2 concrete.

There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.
