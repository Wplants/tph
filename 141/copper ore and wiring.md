Copper Ore is an early game ore, which spawns on the surface as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. It is the weakest and most easily obtained tier of ore in the game. Its primary use is to make Copper Bars, which can be used to create the Copper tier of equipment. The equivalent of Copper Ore is Tin Ore, which will sometimes replace Copper in a world.

Copper is used widely in plumbing components and is a major component of alloys, many of which are harder, stronger and tougher than their individual constituent elements. In 1837 Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke patented the first electric telegraph, using copper wire. In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell was the first to use copper telephone wire.

## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

## Copper Wire - Conductive Properties, Size Chart, & Alternatives
When considering other metals with a similiar conductivity profile, silver provides a strong potential alternative. Silver is approximately 7% more conductive than Copper by length. However, longer lengths of silver wire reduce its efficiency as an electrical conductor. It also oxidizes at a faster rate than Copper.
