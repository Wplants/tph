## Crushed stone mastic asphalt concrete
Crushed stone mastic asphalt concrete (SCMA) or crushed stone mastic asphalt is a type of pavement developed in the 1960s in Germany. Differs in high durability, is suitable for heavily loaded highways. ASM is characterized by a high content of crushed stone of dense rocks, which forms a stone skeleton that successfully resists deformations.

Mar 22, 2021Stone mastic asphalt (SMA) is a stone-on-stone like skeletal structure of gap graded aggregate, bonded together by mastic, which actually is higher binder content, filler and fibre to reduce the binder drain. This structure improves the strength and the performance of SMA even higher than the dense graded and open graded asphalt mixtures.
