## zinc processing - Ores | Britannica
The small fraction of zinc sulfide minerals present in the ore makes beneficiation necessary in order to produce a concentrate suitable for treatment. The most common method for accomplishing this concentration is to isolate the sulfide mineral from the impure constituents, or gangue, by flotation separation.  The basic steps in this process

## A review of zinc oxide mineral beneficiation using flotation method 
Using the leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning process route is the most common method of extraction of zinc from low-grade zinc oxide deposits. The application of whole-ore-leaching is likely to be uneconomical, and the separation of the acid-consuming gangue minerals prior to leaching is essential to the successful recovery of zinc from

## Zinc Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A. Mohamad Ghazi, James R. Millette, in Environmental Forensics, 1964. 4.3.2 Mining and Production of Lead. Lead and zinc ores often occur together, and there are a large number of countries that mine and process lead ore, making it among the most widespread metals in terms of primary production (Kesler, 1994).Most of lead mining is done by highly mechanized underground methods, although some
