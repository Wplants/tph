## Ruby and Spinel in Tajikistan • Moon Over the Pamirs - Lotus Gemology
The Snezhny mining camp, consisting of about 15 rustic houses, lies about 42 km by road east-northeast of Murghab on a gentle slope at the end of an arid high-altitude valley. As one can see, the scenery surrounding the mines is just beyond spectacular. Lunar landscape near the Snezhny ruby mines in eastern Tajikistan. Photo: Richard W. Hughes

## Tajikistan: Chinese company gets gold mine in return for power plant 
In 2011, Tajikistan's parliament voted to ratify an agreement to cede around 1,000 square kilometers of land to China in exchange for the waiving of a large outstanding debt running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The gold mining concession has now proven another way in which to pay off liabilities.
