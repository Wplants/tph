Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

## Extraction of Iron - Online Math Learning
We can extract the iron by reacting the iron oxide with a more reactive element. The more reactive element takes away the oxygen. The raw materials are Haematite (iron ore), Coke (impure C), Limestone (CaCO 3) Make a strong reducing agent. C + O 2 → CO 2. CO 2 + C → 2CO. Reduce the iron 3. Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2.
