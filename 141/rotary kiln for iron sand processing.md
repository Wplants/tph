## Making of Iron Nugget From Concentrated Iron Sand Using Mini  - Esdm
iron sand concentrates were oxidized in a rotary kiln for 2 hours with variations of oxidation temperatures, starting from 600 to 1100°C. The reduction process was performed in a mini-sized rotary kiln performing diameter of 0.6 m and length of 6 m to form an iron nugget. Oxidation and reduction processes were carried out in the same rotary kiln.

## Rotary Kiln For Iron Sand Processing
Rotary Kilns Proxitron. Rotary kilns in modern cement plants cement production is a continuous dry process where the rotary kiln plays a key role in the first step raw materials such as limestone clay sand and iron ore are crushed in a cone mill and dried this raw meal or slurry is then fed to a rotary kiln an enormous rotating pipe and heated at a temperature of c to become clinker in

## IBU-tec | The Rotary Kiln Experts for Trials and Production
Rotary kilns (sometimes called calciners or rotary furnaces) are used for thermal treatment processes such as calcination, sintering, pyrolysis and firing, as well as for oxidation and reduction.These treatments can be applied to powders, granulates, suspensions and green bodies.A rotary kiln consists of a cylindrical, rotating body mounted between stationary material feed and outlet housings.
