##  Geoenvironmental impact of Okpara coal mine, Enugu, Southeastern Nigeria
The Enugu coal mine district covers 270,000 hectares of coal basin, which supported the largest amount of commercial mining in the past. It has an estimated coal reserves of 49 million tones [9]. The present study focused on the environmental impact assessment of Okpara coal mine in the Enugu area.

Considerations of the geological units, the static groundwater levels and groundwater seepages in the mines indicate that the coal sequence is a multiaquifer system in which sandstone and coal aquifers alternate with shale aquitards. Based on the hydraulic head data, the groundwater flow is predominantly downwards.
