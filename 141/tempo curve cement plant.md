## Cement Plant - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The mass and energy balances for the cement plant concepts with carbon capture were used furthermore to evaluate the key plant performances. The designs were optimized by performing a heat integration analysis (using pinch technique) for maximization of the overall energy efficiency (Smith, 2005).As an illustrative example, Figure 1 presents the hot and cold composite curves for the calcium

## Explained: Cement vs. concrete — their differences, and opportunities 
Cement production begins with limestone, a sedimentary rock. Once quarried, it is mixed with a silica source, such as industrial byproducts slag or fly ash, and gets fired in a kiln at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. What comes out of the kiln is called clinker. Cement plants grind clinker down to an extremely fine powder and mix in a few additives.
