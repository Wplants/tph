## Rod Mills
Rod mills came into use in the United States beginning in the 1900s and eventually became recognized as efficient fine crushers. The 1st ever built rod mill (2 m in diameter by 4 m long) was to be installed at a mine where a coarser feed was required for shaking tables. Crushing rolls and rod mills were eventually used commonly to prepare feed

rod mills, how they function - mine . Wet grinding rod mills are normally used in the mineral processing industry. Dry grinding is used in some areas; however, it is confronted with problems and should be avoided except where absolutely necessary. Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.

The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (-4 to -35 mesh).
