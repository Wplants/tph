The concept is applied to two types of plant: the geothermal-preheat hybrid and the fossil-superheat hybrid. In the first, the geothermal fluid is used for preheating the feedwater in a Rankine steam power cycle; in the second, steam produced by flashing a geothermal fluid is superheated in a fossil-fired superheater.

Power Plant Energy Education. Fossil fuel power plants burn their fuel in order to create the thermal energy to run their external heat engines. A simple cycle gas plant does not use steam like the others it works similar to a jet engine where natural gas is ignited and burned and the heat creates pressure that turns the turbine.

## Fossil fuel power station
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity.Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator.The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating gas engine.
