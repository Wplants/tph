## Process Of Hard Rock Mining
Mining The Hard Rock Mining Process The gold milling process may be broken down into three basic procedures 1 Sorting the ore by size. 2 Crushing the rock. 3 Extracting the gold. First miners raise the ore out of the mine in wheeled carts pushed on rails and take it down to the mill.

Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces. Transportation The taconite pieces are scooped up by electric shovels. Each shovel can hold up to 85 tons of rock. The shovels place the taconite into giant dump trucks. These trucks are as big as a house and hold up to 240 tons of taconite.

## Hard Rock Mining: the process | BI News
Oct 22, 2021The technological process of hardrock mining begins when enough gold is found in the ore. Mining was dangerous and labor-intensive in the 1930s. Miners worked by digging tunnels in solid rock. These miners were often at risk of their health digging tunnels into solid rock by hand with picks or shovels for long periods in dark tunnels.

The former follows traditional mining processes, requiring geological surveys and exploration prior to using heavy machinery to remove soil and find lithium-rich deposits within hard rock. These actions alone can already scar environments and disrupt local ecology, however, processing these deposits also creates issues.
