## Manufactured Sand: A Stronger Alternative to Decomposed Granite
Manufactured Sand. Our Manufactured Sand can be kiln dried. It creates more reliable and consistent cement and mortar mixes compared to river sand. Manufactured Sand is also a superior alternative to decomposed granite or paver sand. It lacks the impurities found in river sand and is stronger than decomposed granite, so it will last longer.
