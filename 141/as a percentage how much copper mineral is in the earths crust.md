## Abundance of elements in Earth's crust
The abundance of elements in Earth's crust is shown in tabulated form with the estimated crustal abundance for each chemical element shown as mg/kg, or parts per million (ppm) by mass (10,000 ppm = 1%). Estimates of elemental abundance are difficult because (a) the composition of the upper and lower crust are quite different, and (b) the

## Geology: What are the most abundant minerals on Earth's crust?
Answer (1 of 36): The most common rock in the Earth's crust is basalt, which continuously wells up from below at the Earths divergent plates, and covers almost all the ocean floor. The most common minerals in basalt are pyroxene and plagioclase. Both minerals have a varying composition of sodium

To date, roughly 700 million metric tons of copper have been produced around the world. This would fit into a cube measuring about 430 meters on a side. Identified deposits contain an estimated 2.1 billion metric tons of additional copper, which brings the total amount of discovered copper to 2.8 billion metric tons.

## Earth's Crust: Elements, Minerals and Rocks - ClearIAS
Minerals in the Earth's Crust. A mineral is a naturally occurring organic or inorganic substance, having an orderly atomic structure and a definite chemical composition and physical properties. A mineral is composed of two or more elements. But, sometimes single element minerals like sulphur, copper, silver, gold, graphite, etc are also found.

Arsenic ranks twentieth among the elements in abundance in the earth's crust. The abundance of arsenic in the continental crust of the earth is generally given as 1.5-2 ppm. Thus, it is relatively scarce. Nevertheless, it is a major constituent of no fewer than 245 mineral species. Arsenic is found in high concentration in sulfide deposits, where it is present as the native element or alloys

The planet is made up of three main shells: the very thin, brittle crust, the mantle and the core. The core forms only 15 percent of the Earth's volume, whereas the mantle occupies 84 percent. The crust makes up the remaining 1 percent. The composition of the crust is quite different from that of the Earth as a whole.

## Earth's crust
Earth's crust is Earth's thin outer shell of rock, regarding for less than 1% of Earth's radius and volume.It is the top component of the lithosphere, a division of Earth's layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates whose motion allows heat to escape from the interior of the Earth into space.

The crust is compositionally distinct outermost rocky layer of the Earth. What is the crust made of? The answer to this question depends on whether we want to know which chemical elements, minerals or rock types it is made of. It may be surprising but about a dozen chemical elements, minerals, or rock types is all that it takes to describe approximately 99% of the crust.
