## Depositional palaeoenvironments of the coal-bearing Permian Vryheid 
coal-bearing Vryheid Formation has been found to be predominantly of fluvio-deltaic origin (Tankard et al., 1982). The present study area is located in a 270 km2 area of the east Witbank Coalfield (Figures 1B & 1 C), and has been extensively core-drilled during coal exploration programmes, and during mining operations.
