Beneficiation is the process of increasing the concentration of a valuable component of an ore. Native iron particles exist in lunar soil in fairly large quantities. They come from nickel-iron meteorites, which become pulverized upon impact.These iron particles are tiny (fine grained) and well mixed into the fine dust of the lunar regolith.As they are in a metallic state and strongly magnetic
