## Producing concrete from  industrial sludge
The secret of this technique is in some chemicals prepared by Mr. Binh to handle odors and bind sludge, which can replace sand used in concrete production. These chemicals are named BOF1, BOF2 and HSOB. Waste sludge after being taken up (fresh mud) will be treated with BOF1 and BOF2 chemical odors for about 15 minutes.

For every 100 gallons of water, they recommend adding three cups of household liquid bleach (5 percent to 8.25 percent strength) for disinfection purposes. So, for a 500-gallon tank, you'd add 15 cups of bleach. Let the water -bleach mixture sit in the tank for a minimum of 12 hours.

The on-site point-of-sale septic system inspection will typically begin with a "flow test.". This test seeks to determine whether the pipe used to transport liquid to the system is functioning and intact. To do this, the technician will turn on all water in the house to "charge" the system with ½ of the water the system is designed to.

## What to do with "concrete waste" at any type of concrete plant.
Your best solution for excess concrete materials at any concrete plant starts with simply addressing the issue, and developing a plan. Without a plan, your pile of "concrete waste" will likely continue to grow. With a well thought-out plan, you'll find operational, compliance, and financial benefits you likely aren't receiving now.
