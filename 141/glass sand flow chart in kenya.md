## Glass Sand - Banglapedia
The glass sand at Barapukuria was discovered in 1985 at a depth of 118m to 180m below the surface while drilling for coal in the basin. The average thickness of the sand is 21.90m and the reserves in an area of one square kilometre is 90 million ton. Besides these, subsurface deposits of glass sand was also found at Dighipara basin in 1994.

## Glass Cutting Process: Introduction, Properties, Types, Applications 
The glass is made by heating ordinary sand (which is mostly made up of silicon dioxide) until it melts and turns into a liquid. Sand melts at a high temperature of 1700°C (3090°F). In a glass plant, sand is mixed with waste glass, limestone (calcium carbonate), and soda ash (sodium carbonate) heated in a furnace.

The concept of Sand Filter: Solid turbid particles become lodged into the sand bed. As more dirt is captured in the sand bed, it becomes capable of filtering finer and finer particulate, up to a point. In order for the filter to be effective, each grain of sand must be roughly the same size, generally 0.4 to 0.6 millimeters.
