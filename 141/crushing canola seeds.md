## How is Canola Oil Made? - Canadian Food Focus
For canola - one of Canada's most widely grown crops - it starts with a good squeeze. As the canola plant matures, its yellow flowers develop into pods, containing tiny black seeds. Similar to other plant-based oils, canola oil is made by crushing canola seeds. There are two main methods of crushing canola.
