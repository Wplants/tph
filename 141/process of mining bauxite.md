Approximately 98% of the alumina produced worldwide is manufactured via the Bayer process, which consists of digestion and calcination. Initially, the bauxite is washed and ground. During digestion, the bauxite is dissolved in caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) at high pressure (40-220 bar) and at high temperature (°C).

Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide

Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.
