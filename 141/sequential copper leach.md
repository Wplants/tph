## Producing Copper Nature's Way: Bioleaching
The "Gall-Copper Process" was recorded as being used during the Song Dynasty (AD). Copper was precipitated from solution by dipping iron into the blue vitriol solution - a process identified as early as 150 BC in China. 6 Therefore, presumably, the recognition of a natural copper leaching process can be identified as early as that date.

## A sequential leaching procedure for efficient recovery of gold and 
An effective method for sequential recovery of copper and precious metals (Ag, Au) without using corrosive acids or strong oxidants was developed. In the process, gold and silver were enriched during copper recovery process.  The great difference may be attributed to the dissolution of copper during the leaching process of the raw PCBs. It
