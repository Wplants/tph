Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores. An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities. When the metal is dug up, a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore. This is called extracting the metal. The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is. The more reactive the metal, the more difficult it is to

Cassiterite is a tin oxide mineral with a chemical composition of SnO 2. It is the most important source of tin, and most of the world's supply of tin is obtained by mining cassiterite. Small amounts of primary cassiterite are found in igneous and metamorphic rocks throughout the world. It is also a residual mineral found in soils and sediments.
