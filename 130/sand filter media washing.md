## Pool Filter Not Backwashing? (What You Need To Do!) - The Pool And Deck
The bigger debris sits on top of the sand. Minerals go through the sand media and deposit in the bottom layer. Backwashing of the sand filter is done to clean up the sand media and expel the trapped dirt & debris to waste. In theory the sand media should be as good as new after a backwash. In practice, backwashing will not clear the sand media

## When to Backwash A Sand Filter | Sand Filter Maintenance - The Pool Butler
Take note of the filter pressure after the last time you backwashed the filter. When the pressure gauge on your filter reads 8-10 pounds higher than that, it is time backwash again. Backwashing the filter is a relatively simple process. To clean the sand, you just run the water backwards, loosening and knocking out all the built up particles.
