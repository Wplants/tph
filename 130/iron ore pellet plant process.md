Then the iron ore pellets will sent through metallic conveyor into the furnace to undergo heating process at 1200 degrees. After the heating process, the heated base mix will converted into a semi liquid cake. Using a sinter breaker machine the cake is break into small pellets. Finally these iron ore pellets under goes cooling in the cooling tower.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
