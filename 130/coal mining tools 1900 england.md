## From Shovels to Machines - West Virginia
The Mines Today. From the days of the salt industry until the 1940s, most coal was loaded using hand tools like picks and shovels. Machines were introduced gradually during the early 1900s, allowing miners to load more coal in less time. Mechanization began with undercutting machines around 1900 and advanced to loading machines in the 1920s.

At the beginning of the war miners were the largest single group of industrial workers in Britain. Coal production increased during the first few months of the conflict.

## Coal Mining, - Boulder County Latino History
The coal mines in Boulder County formed part of the Northern Colorado Coal Field,whose mines were developed in the first decades of the 20th century as the Southern Colorado Coal Field (around Trinidad and Walsenburg) gradually closed down. These northern mines produced Lignite, a soft, brown, "dirty" coal used for railroad locomotives

Coal miners were paid by the amount and quality of the coal they produced, and they could be fined if there was too much "slack" (the smaller pieces). Quality coal was what owners required, but managers determined the standards for quality coal. Owners could keep costs low by claiming the coal was of a poor quality or rigging their scales.

History Hit. 01 Jun 2019. On 18th December 2015, the closure of Kellingly Colliery in North Yorkshire, England, marked the end of deep coal mining in Britain. Coal was formed between 170 and 300 million years ago. It began life as forests and vegetation. When this plant-life died, it rotted away and was buried and compacted into layers underground.

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution - History Learning Site
Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

There were two big engineering problems in mining coal underground: A system to drain water from the mine. A system to ventilate the mine and to provide fresh air to the miners. A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode. Andrew Roy was one
