As previously mentioned, cold agglomeration of fine ground ore is the basic mechanism of pellet manufacture. The ore is wetted, mixed with an agglomerating agent and rolled in a rotating con­tainer. The rolling action in the container starts a snow-ball effect whereby ore particles adhere to one another and eventually form small pellets.
