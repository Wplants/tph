## The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide
The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically fall and impact

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical

Mixed mode - the rolling the grinding balls when part of the grinding balls move in a circular trajectory with further fall. Waterfall - the grinding balls move along a circular trajectory and change it further under gravity.

Operation and Elements of a Closed Circuit Ball Mill System. Cement ball mills typically have two grinding chambers. The first chamber is filled with larger diameter grinding media and lined with lifting liners. The first chamber coarse-grinds the feed material and prepares it for the second chamber. The second chamber is the fine grinding chamber.
