## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs /nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.

## How to improve working efficiency of ball mill
Control Feed Size. The particle size of the material entering the ball mill is controlled between 25-15 mm (the diameter of the ball mill is different for different feed sizes). Excessive rules will cause the ball mill to have too much fine material during the grinding process and cannot achieve the friction between the material and the material.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls. Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.

## Ball Mill Loading - Dry Milling - Paul O. Abbe
The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%
