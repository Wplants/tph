## Above-Ground Pool Base Materials Explained
Above-ground pools must have a base material in order to withstand many tons of water weight. Mason Sand or Stone Dust is what installers use. Other accessories include Rhino Pad, Armor Guard, and or Liner Shield. These three items are GEO textile materials that protect the pool's liner. They all lay between the liner and the base material.

Aggregate particle shape is the second key component in footing material selection. Sharply angular materials (like manufactured sand or stone dust) are more prone to compaction than "sub-angular" particles. Sharply angular materials fit tightly together and have smaller void spaces between the particles than the less angular particles.
