## Diy Ball Mill For Reclaiming Clay And Making Glaze
Josh, I am very interested to hear how you make out with your ball mill. I also have been planning to make one. I dig my own clay and have been using the slaking method. It does work, but, during a residency i did recently, I had access to a ball mill. I found you just cant beat it for making dry material for glazes and slips.

## Temperature Reduction for Ball Mill Optimization | Lechler US
Heat taken away by ventilation systems can accounts for roughly 20% of the total heat discharged by the ball mill. Improving that ventilation system brings more cool air into the inside of the ball bill, gradually reducing the internal temperature. However, the major benefit of using ball mills is the product fineness they can deliver.
