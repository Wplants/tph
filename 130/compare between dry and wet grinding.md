## A comparison of wet and dry autogenous grinding
There has been a well established "truth" that wet grinding is more efficient than dry grinding. This should apply to ball mill grinding as well as autogenous grinding. It has been earlier shown that the effect of dry ball mill grinding increases considerably, when the fines are efficiently removed from the mill.

## Wet Milling vs Dry Milling: The Differences, Advantages, and Challenges 
Now that we have a basic understanding of the industrial milling process, let's examine the difference between wet milling and dry milling. Dry milling typically uses particle-on-particle contact to reduce materials' size, while wet milling involves dispersing the material in a liquid and using solid, grinding elements to reduce size.

## comparison between dry and wet grinding mill power consumption
Wet grinding is more efficient. It has a higher production capacity and lower power consumption than the dry grinding. The material is easy to flow. The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution.
