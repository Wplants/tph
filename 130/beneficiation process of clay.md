## Beneficiation and mineral processing of clay minerals
3. Clay is a naturally occurring material composed primarily of fine grained minerals, which shows plasticity through a variable range of water content and which can be hardened when dried or fired. Clay deposits are mostly composed of clay minerals (phyllosilicate minerals) and variable amount of water trapped in the mineral. Clay materials
