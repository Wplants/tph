## How Are Minerals Mined - Realonomics
There are two types of mines. Surface mines (A) are used to remove minerals found naturally near the surface of the Earth. In surface mines minerals (ore) are accessed by digging a big open pit. Underground mines (B) are used when minerals are located deep beneath the Earth's surface. How and where the mineral is mined?

## 3 ways to use water to cool your underground mine  - Stantec
To avoid contamination, you can use a closed loop heat exchanger. This consists of an array of pipes at the bottom of the lake that transfers cooling to the mine's cooling heat exchanger. So, as the water gets pumped around and into a heat exchanger, the mine's ventilation air gets cooled down. 2. Seasonal thermal storage (aka ice stopes
