## 10 Advantages and Disadvantages of Quarrying Limestone
The market for limestone is remarkably consistent. Quarried limestone can be used to neutralize acidity, so it can be added to soils or lakes. Limestone is used in the iron manufacturing industry, is required for cement, concrete, and mortar mixes, and is heated with sand and sodium carbonate to create glass. 3. It is extremely affordable.

## History of Iron and Steel in Scotland | Clydebridge
In 1892 the available capacity of the Scottish iron industry was about 1,250,000 tons of pig-iron, requiring three million tons of iron ore (two million of which were imported), two and a quarter million tons of coal and about half a million tons of limestone. The associated labour cost to produce this iron was about Â£1 million.

Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure, its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds, which influences its color.
