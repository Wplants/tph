## Brief Introduction of Magnetite Beneficiation Process and Equipment
Magnetite occupies a large proportion of China's iron mineral reserves, reaching 48.8%. Finding a reasonable magnetite beneficiation technology and machinery to deal with magnetite is of great significance for the development of our country's mines and the development of the entire steel industry.

## industrial separation process of iron from iron ore
Iron Ore Smelting Process The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the
