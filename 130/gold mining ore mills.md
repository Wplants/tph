## Argo Mine & Mill - Gold Prospecting Mining Equipment Detectors Snake 
The Argo Gold Mill and Argo Tunnel in Idaho Springs, Colorado made quite an impact on the state's mining history. It all began in 1859 with the first discovery of placer gold, and continued until 1943 following a fatal underground accident that closed the mill and tunnel forever. The best way to learn about this significant time in Colorado

These conditions, together with the following, have been instrumental in determining the method of mining: (a) The Chinese worked the mine from the surface to 50 ft. below the 171-ft. level for the silver alone and consequently did not want lead ore, high in zinc or low-grade ore; so that there is a large remnant of.

The same question arises in connection with the economical working of numerous small but relatively high grade ore deposits. Portable Mills, and in particular, Truck Mills, are a most practical solution to this problem. For a relatively small investment a complete and efficient mill can be brought to the mine and speedily put into operation.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.
