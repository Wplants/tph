These conditions, together with the following, have been instrumental in determining the method of mining: (a) The Chinese worked the mine from the surface to 50 ft. below the 171-ft. level for the silver alone and consequently did not want lead ore, high in zinc or low-grade ore; so that there is a large remnant of.

The same question arises in connection with the economical working of numerous small but relatively high grade ore deposits. Portable Mills, and in particular, Truck Mills, are a most practical solution to this problem. For a relatively small investment a complete and efficient mill can be brought to the mine and speedily put into operation.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.
