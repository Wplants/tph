## toxic materials in appalachian coal mining
In 2002, the Bush Administration changed the definition of "fill material" in the Clean Water Act to include toxic mining waste, which allowed coal companies to legally create valley fills. Processing - Coal must be washed and treated before it is shipped to power plants for burning.

## Health effects of coal - Global Energy Monitor
Coal Mining. Health effects from coal mining include: the release of methane (CH 4), a potent greenhouse gas estimated to account for 18% of the overall global warming effect triggered by human activities (CO 2 is estimated to contribute 50%).; the release of carbon monoxide (CO) from explosives, which pollutes the air and poses a health risk for mine workers.

## Mountaintop removal mining
Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or overburden, above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.

Layers of rock and dirt above and between the coal seams are removed. Coal seams are removed with excess soil and rock placed in an adjacent valley. Large scale earth moving equipment is used to excavate and remove coal from lower layers. The equipment used depends on the method and scale of the surface mining method being employed.

Although life in the coal mining towns was a step up for the more impoverished Appalachian families, most found it to be a meager existence. Miners were typically paid $3-$5 a day for a 12-hour work day. Many young boys went into the mines with their fathers to perform "dead work" for which the miner wasn't paid.
