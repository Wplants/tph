## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
A 2000 MW power station could be handling coal in the range of 1600 tons/hr or around 12 million tons of coal annually. A single 500 MW unit consumes in the range of 400 tons/hr of coal. The coal input to the boiler of the power plant passes through three different phases before combustion in the boiler.

Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.

##  Coal fired boiler performance improvement through combustion optimization
The most accepted method of measuring boiler efficiency is the "heat loss" method. Most Eastern Bituminous coal fired utility boilers are capable of around efficiency. It should be pointed out that 90% boiler efficiency can be maintained — yet unit heat rate penalties experienced at that given time may represent more than — or about 200 BTU
