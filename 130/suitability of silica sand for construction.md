## What Is the Difference Between Washed Sand & Silica Sand? - Al Manaratain
Washed Sand. 'Washed' refers to the process of removing clay, silt, dust and other unwanted particles from the sand. Once the excess materials have been removed, the sand is left to drain. Washed sand is ideal for rendering, mixing concrete and for making a less malleable mortar that is often used for and flagstones.

## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
How Silica Sand Is Different From Regular Sand. Regular sand, also known as feldspathic sand, brown sand, or construction sand, will always contain some silica, but only in amounts less than 95%. For example, typical brown sand used for concrete applications can contain up to 80% SiO2, along with varying amounts of iron, carbonate, potassium
