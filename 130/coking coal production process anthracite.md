Although chemical composition alone cannot be used to predict whether a coal is suitable for coking, prime coking coals generally have volatile matter contents of 20 to 32 percentâ€”i.e., the low- and medium-volatile bituminous ranks.

## Coke Making Process
The coking process generates the following main volatiles as byproducts: coke oven gas, tar, ammonium sulfate, benzol, toluol and naphtha. A coke battery is made up of multiple ovens. Coal is crushed and blended prior to being charged in a coke oven. A larry car charges the individual oven with the blended coal.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

## What You Should Know About Metallurgical Coal - ThoughtCo
Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke, the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. Coal is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock formed over millions of years as plants and other organic materials are buried and subjected to geological forces.

## Estimating carbon dioxide emissions from coal mines
For coking coal, the Production Gap report estimated 0.645 (64.5%) of the carbon dioxide should be "excluded", meaning these emissions will be counted in the process fuel or industrial category (e.g. metallurgic coke used in iron and steel production) rather than as power sector emissions.

coking coal production process anthracite. Anthracite is a high-rank coal, representing a coal that has been subjected to the highest grade of metamorphism. Anthracite is shiny black, hard and brittle and has the highest fixed-carbon content. Due to its low volatile matter, anthracites combustion process is slow.

## Anthracite (Coal) | Carbonesholding
Anthracite has the highest content of fixed carbon and the lowest ratio of volatile matter of all natural coal types. It is therefore an excellent carbon donator in metallurgical processes. Together with metal scrap, anthracite is used as charge coal acting at once as a carbon carrier and energy provider in the steel making process.
