## Application Of Enzymes In Pulp And Paper Industry - Infinita Biotech
Different enzymes are used at different steps in the process of papermaking. Some of the major and most effective enzymes used in the paper industry are xylanase, cellulase, lipase, and laccase. Xylanase is an enzyme that is most effective in the process of pre-bleaching the pulp. Cellulase is used to boost the fibre modification process.
