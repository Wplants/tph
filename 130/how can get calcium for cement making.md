## Calcium Aluminate Cement Concrete - Concrete Construction
Calcium aluminate cement concretes are not rapid setting. They are, however, rapid hardening; that is, they will develop as much strength in 24 hours as Portland cement concrete will achieve in 28 days. Calcium aluminate cement concretes should be cured for at least 24 hours, using a water spray or fog, ponding, wet burlap or a curing membrane.

## Calcium phosphate cement: review of mechanical and biological 
Results: Calcium phosphate cement appears to have excellent biological properties. At only 2 weeks, spicules of living bone with normal bone marrow and osteocytes can be seen. Excellent moldability is a desired clinical characteristic; however, further research is necessary in order to improve the mechanical properties of the cement.

Share. Calcium Chloride is the most effective accelerator for concrete because of its strength and quality. Concrete is produced at an estimated rate of 9 BILLION cubic yards per year. It is the most widely consumed substance on Earth, second only to water. If the temperature drops below 70 degrees, the setting of ready mix concrete slows down.
