## Late 20th Century Coal Mining | Energy History - Yale University
Starting in the early 1960s, however, coal producers found a new purpose - meeting the rapidly growing demand for electricity from coal-fired electric generating plants. By 1980, eighty-one percent of the nation's coal consumption went to electric power; by 2000, that share increased further to ninety-one percent.

## History of coal mining
The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today
