Valbaux's Calcined Bauxite Making Process. Bauxite - Mining & Drilling : It is usually strip mined (Surface Mining) because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain, with little or no overburden. Developmental drilling entails demarcation of the mining area by drilling cores and then defining the position of the ore body.

Next, bauxite is extracted by digging, ripping, and blasting, all of which creates dust plumes. Following extraction, bauxite is trucked along haul roads to stockpiles where it is then loaded onto trains, or in some cases larger trucks, for transport to port facilities for further processing — washing, crushing, and drying — and shipping.

Bauxite is the only ore containing 20-25 percent of aluminium from where the metal is extracted and commercially produced. The open pit or surface mining process is carried in this case since bauxite is mostly found near surface areas where the layers of soil contain a mixed amount of various minerals, iron oxides and titanium dioxide.

## what is the material bauxite used for
Mining and Refining - Process - World Aluminium The aluminium-containing bauxite ores gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore are the basic raw material for primary aluminium production. Proven, economically viable reserves of bauxite are sufficient to supply at least another 100 years at current demand.
