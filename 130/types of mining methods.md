## Data Mining Techniques: Top 5 to Consider - Precisely
Below are 5 data mining techniques that can help you create optimal results. 1. Classification analysis. This analysis is used to retrieve important and relevant information about data, and metadata. It is used to classify different data in different classes. Classification is similar to clustering in a way that it also segments data records

Open-pit Mining. Open-pit mining is a method in which an ore is removed by digging a pit in the ground, and is used to remove copper, gold, iron, as well as non-metallic minerals. It is normally used when the rock layer above the ore is too weak to allow underground tunnels. In this technique, circular steps, or 'benches', are dug around

In this method, ore is mined in horizontal slices, starting from the bottom to the top of the stope. The broken ore is left in the mined-out stope and serves as a support to the stope walls and a working platform for mining the ore above.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.
