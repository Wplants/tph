Polyacrylamides (PAMs) are used in sand and gravel quarries as water purification flocculants for recycling process water in a recycling loop system where the flocculants remove fine particles in the form of sludge. The PAM-based flocculants, however, contain residual amounts of acrylamide (AMD) that did not react during the polymerization process.

Having your own gravel can really save a lot of money. Dry bags of portland cement costs about $5 a bag and it takes 5 of them to make a cubic yard. Do the math on that and you end up with $25 a yard. Considering pre-mixed concrete costs me $90 a cubic yard here and you can see a cement mixer quickly pays for itself.
