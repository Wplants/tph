A. Mill scale consists primarily of magnetite,Fe 3 O 4, of characteristic blue-gray "steely" color. An extremely thin outer film of hematite, Fe 2 O 3, is invisible to the naked eye. The inner portion of the magnetite contains fine metal grains and sometimes, residual black FeO (see below), which contribute to the roughness of descaled metal.

There are several ways to remove a mill-scale: Firstly, iIt can be done by grinding, shot blasting or chemical removal. Material with a mill-scale is also deliberately allowed to rust (oxidise). By oxidizing, the mill-scale dissolves more or less and can easily be removed by sanding. Another way of removing mill-scale is "drumming".

Pad diameters are 1.9mm, but I would probably use 2mm next time for the 1mm rivets. You could get away with shrinking the pads for the 0.6mm rivets.
