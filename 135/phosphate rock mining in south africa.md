## Proudly South African supplier of phosphate - SA Grain
By 1951 South Africa was importing around 500 000 tons of phosphate rock per year on more than 100 ships delivering the rock. Extrapolations at the time showed that this figure would increase to 500 ships per year. Self-sufficient With the foregoing in mind, the possibility of a phosphate mine making South Africa self-sufficient in phosphates

##  How phosphate is mined and processed
rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants. The solubility also depends on rock type and the pH of the soil; phosphorus is most soluble when contained in sedimentary rocks as opposed to igneous rock, and when soil pH is between 5.5 and 7.2.
