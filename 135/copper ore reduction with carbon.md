Hint: In this method of carbon-based reduction the metal ore is decomposed by treating the ore with heat and a chemical reducing agent like a carbon source to extract the metal. The oxides which have a higher affinity for oxygen than carbon, cannot be reduced using carbon.

Its CO₂ target includes a 40% reduction in total emissions (including scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2035, compared with 2019 levels, before a goal of net-zero total emissions by 2050. The company intends to achieve this by lowering operating emissions, reducing coal production, increasing investment in low-carbon metals such as copper, cobalt, nickel
