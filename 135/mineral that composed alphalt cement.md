## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.

Prime coat . It's similar to a primer in painting. A thin layer of low viscosity liquid bituminous material is first applied, using a mechanical sprayer @7.3 to 14.6 Kg/10 m2 are, over an existing porous surface.It's mainly applied to plug in the capillary voids of the porous surface and to bind together all the loose minerals particles on the existing surface.

## Asphalt concrete
Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac, bitumen macadam, or rolled asphalt in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, airports, and the core of embankment dams. Asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the beginning of the twentieth century.

Asphalt seal coats areposed of a thin layer of an asphalt material such as cutbacks, asphalt emulsions, or paving-grade asphalt cement.  Microsurfacing uses a polymer-modified emulsion mixed with crushed aggregate, mineral filler (cement, lime, limestone dust, flyash), water, and additives. The additives influence the mix time and set time.
