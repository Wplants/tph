## How Does Vibration Analysis Work?
How Vibration Analysis Works. After taking a measurement with a vibration analyzer when the sensor is mounted to the machine, the analyzer will read the incoming electrical voltage generated by the piezoelectric crystal and generate what is known as a Time Waveform (time domain). This plot compares the amplitude of vibration versus time.
