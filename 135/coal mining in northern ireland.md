Coal mining began in Ireland in the Leinster coal field in 1638. The Leinster coal field covers parts of Kilkenny, Carlow and Laois. Ireland was an early adopter of steam power with the first steam engine in Ireland being used to pump water in a mine as early as 1740. Coal mining at Arigna in County Roscommon began in 1765 and lasted until 1990.
