## How To Extract Gold From Rock
Generally, differing kinds of gold ores are extracted in an exceedingly general open and underground manner. Extracting ore from open mines is way easier and might be through with lower investment and operating costs. About 65 percent of the gold ore within the u. s. is currently extracted in open mines and 35 percent in underground mines.

The effect of pH value on gold extraction for various ore types is shown in Figure 28.4. Greatly increasing pH value has a beneficial effect on gold extraction for both oxide and sulfide ores and stabilizes ∼pH 9.5-10.0, whereas for some carbonaceous ores, pH value has no apparent effect. However, the outcome will vary depending on the

## how gold is extracted from ore
Gold and mercury quickly form an alloy, so people have used mercury amalgamation for centuries to extract gold from ore. The ore must be thoroughly clean to ensure optimum contact between the gold in the ore and the introduced mercury. One way to clean it is to wash the ore in a solution of nitric acid.

Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

Usually, however, the amount of gold is so minute that the cost of extracting it would exceed its value. Where gold occurs in higher concentrations, the deposits are of two basic types—veins, or lodes, of gold-bearing ore, and placer deposits. Since gold rarely enters into chemical reactions, it is usually found in its native state.
