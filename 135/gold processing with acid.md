A process for recovering gold from a concentrate such as electrolytic sludge, a zinc-gold precipitate, general gold scrap or a gravity concentrate. The concentrate is leached in HCl solution with gaseous chlorine to dissolve the gold and base metals and gold is then precipitated from a solution separated from a slurry produced by the leaching process.

## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

There is a decent reaction when nitric acid hits the copper/gold solution. A cloud of dangerous gas is released, so it is better to do this outside and stand up wind at the same time. After the reaction is finished, and all is calm, more acid is added, until there is no more reaction.

Gold is leached as Au (CN) 2− by chemical reactions involving Cu (I) cyanides present in the system. Copper tailing containing ppm Cu as CuFeS 2 and CuS, was leached with sulphuric acid as a pre-treatment step. This step was found to be beneficial as only 30 ppm Cu remained in solution after ammonia-cyanide leaching.

Its role in gold processing is mainly as a pH control agent for optimal cyanidation leaching of gold, as well as a neutralization agent in refractory gold processing via acidic oxidation routes.  In the AVR process, sulfuric acid is added to the alkaline

Alternative alkali and acid methods for gold extraction from low grade copper-gold ores/tailings were studied. Several ores/tailings which originate from South and Western Australia were treated by cyanide, ammonia-cyanide, bromine and sulphuric acid, to achieve optimal reactant concentration for the selection of gold over copper.

## Gold Parting using Nitric Acid - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The process of parting gold with nitric acid is old, and probably dates from the discovery of nitric acid itself; it is one of the simplest parting processes, and does not require a costly plant or much manipulative skill. The main objection to it is the cost of the acid. The operation comprises the preparation of a suitable alloy.

## Aqua regia
Aqua regia dissolves gold, although neither constituent acid will do so alone.Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizer, which will actually dissolve a virtually undetectable amount of gold, forming gold(III) ions (Au 3+).The hydrochloric acid provides a ready supply of chloride ions (Cl −), which react with the gold ions to produce tetrachloroaurate(III) anions ([AuCl 4] −), also in solution.

## Everything about Gold Processing, Smelting, Refining, Cyanidation
Dec 4, 2020Gold processing is about preparing the gold ore for using it in different products. The vital gold ores come with gold in the Indigenous form.  Acid washing and circular movement of a caustic cyanide solution remove gold and silver from the carbon. Electro-winning is necessary to precipitate the precious metals. Next, metal products are

## Process Of Refining Gold | My Gold Guide
Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid are the acids used in this process. When gold is added to the solution containing the acids, impurities separate from the gold. After removing the other substances, the precipitate that remains is 99.999% gold. Using Fire Another process that is used to refine gold involves the application of heat.
