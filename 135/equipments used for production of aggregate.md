Aggregate plans are intermediate-range plans that are valid for three to 18 months. The main objective of aggregate plans is to lower costs and to use capacity most efficiently. The operations department uses the forecasted demand for the planning period to plan the rate of production in such a way that the overall costs are reduced.

However, the term sustainability used in this context, can be used to characterize an aggregate production which is in an optimum balance with the geological resources used, as well as with the various kinds of physical and societal surroundings.

## Use Aggregate Testing Equipment To Improve Aggregate Quality
The word "aggregate" describes a mixture of several medium-grained particulate materials. They generally include materials used in construction sites, such as sand, slag, gravel, concrete, and other geosynthetic aggregates. They also happen to be the most mined materials in the world. The aggregate matter even boasts of a high absorption ratio.
