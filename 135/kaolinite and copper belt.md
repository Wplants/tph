## Kaolinite Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
The kaolinite dry mining process is a simple and economical process. The ore is crushed to 25.4mm by a hammer crusher and fed into the cage mill to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm. The hot air in the cage mill reduces the moisture of the kaolin from about 20% to 10%. The crushed ore is further ground by a blown-type Raymond mill equipped

## Effect of glutamic acid on copper sorption onto kaolinite - Batch 
Glu sorption on kaolinite is weak (<10%) and independent of pH. Furthermore, Glu slightly enhances the Cu(II) sorption at low pH but strongly hinders (up to 50%) the sorption at higher pH and therewith enhances copper mobility. The results of isotherms show that Cu(II)-Glu sorption onto kaolinite mimics the Freundlich model.

## Adsorption of cadmium and copper by modified kaolinites
The present study reveals that the uptake of cadmium and copper ions by modified clays is an ion exchange phenomenon. The possibility of metal ions getting entrapped in the pores also cannot be ruled out. 5. ConclusionThe modified amorphous derivative of kaolinite shows better adsorption of metal ions viz. Cd and Cu than the raw materials.
