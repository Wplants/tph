## Polymers | Free Full-Text | Sustainable Reuse of Waste Tire Textile 
Waste tire textile fibers (WTTF), as a by-product (10-15% by weight of tires) of end-of-life tires (ELT) mechanical recycling (grinding), are classified as hazardous wastes and traditionally burnt (thermal recycling) or buried (landfilling), leading to several environmental and ecological issues. Thus, WTTF still represent an important challenge in today's material recycling streams.

Recycling of Waste Concrete. Recycling of waste concrete is done to reuse the concrete rubble as aggregates in concrete. The recycled aggregates have less crushing strength, impact resistance, specific gravity and has more absorption value as compared to fresh aggregates. Removal of useless concrete from structures, buildings, road pavements etc.
