## Classification and equivariant cohomology of circle actions on 3d 
The first goal of this paper is to further generalize the Orlik-Raymond Classification Theorem to circle actions on compact 3d manifolds, allowing boundaries. By the classification of circle actions on closed 2d manifolds, those boundaries have to be tori T, spheres S 2, projective planes R P 2 or Klein bottles K. Our approach relies on a

Purpose After coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, it is currently not well understood whether the initial coil packing density or the type of aneurysm residual perfusion, depicted by the modified Raymond-Roy occlusion classification, primarily effects the rate of aneurysm recurrence.

The Raymond-Roy occlusion classification (RROC) is an angiographic classification scheme for grading the occlusion of endovascularly treated intracranial aneurysms 1.It is also known as the Raymond class, Montreal scale or the Raymond Montreal scale.. class I: complete obliteration; class II: residual neck; class III: residual aneurysm; The scheme was originally created to evaluate aneurysm
