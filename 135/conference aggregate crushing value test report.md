getting reproducible results. On the contrary, the aggregate crushing test is simple, rapid and gives fairly consistent results. Application of Aggregate Crushing Test: The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low.

The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## What is the significance of ten percent fines value in testing sub-base 
The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e. weight of fines aggregates/weight of all aggregates = 10%). This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed as a percentage of the original mass is the aggregate crushing value.

Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure: One of the test in which concrete material can fail is due to crushing under compressive stress. Aggregate crushing test is standardized by IS: 2386 part-IV and used to verify the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregates should be oven dried, which can passes through 12.5mm and retained on
