## What is a Surface Water Treatment Plant?
Because surface water is more freely available than groundwater, it is used for a variety of human purposes. It is a vital supply of drinking water and is used to irrigate farms. Through direct pumping, it can be easily extracted. Surface water treatment aims to reduce disease-causing organisms and their related health concerns to a safe level.
