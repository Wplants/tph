A quarry is a site where material for construction purposes, such as construction sand, gravel, and quarry rock, is extracted from the earth. Because the definition of 'mineral' in the Mineral Resources Act 1989 excludes most materials used for construction purposes, quarry (or extractive industry) sites are largely approved and administered by

Mining is the removal of minerals from Earth's crust. Quarrying is the mining of stone, or rock used mainly for building. A quarry is a hole or a pit in the ground from which workers remove stone. During quarrying, workers cut or blast stone into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces of stone are easier to handle and can be used to make many things.

## Energy Efficiency for Water Utilities | US EPA
Energy costs often make up 25 to 30 percent of a utility's total operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. They also represent the largest controllable cost of providing water and wastewater services. EPA works with utilities to manage and reduce costs, using the steps described in its Energy Management Guidebook for Wastewater and Water Utilities.
