## How To Extract Metal From Ore? - Realonomics
Jan 13, 2022Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest  Silver: Various chemical reactions: How do we extract ores? An ore is a rock that contains enough metal to make it worthwhile extracting. The ore is crushed then ground into powder.
