## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

When the gangue is processed (finely ground) more waste material is produced which is called mine tailings. Mine tailings is another waste material that must be removed from the site. Open pit mining has several stages of waste. First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock, or overburden, must be removed.

In 2006, Lihir treated 4.3Mt of ore at an average grade of 5.14g/t gold, producing 650,811oz of gold. The total material movement was 56.2Mt, a record. The target for 2007 was to move over 60Mt of ore and waste, with an output of more than 800,000oz. As in previous years, low-grade ore was stockpiled for future treatment.

Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

## Tailing and waste management | SUSTAINABILITY | Gold Fields
In 2021, we generated 1.2kt in hazardous waste, and 10.2kt in non-hazardous waste for disposal, thus achieving our annual target. Gold Fields recycled 63% of all non-mineralised waste generated in 2021, compared with 60% in 2020. Wastes such as plastic, scrap metal, oils and hydrocarbons are recycled off-site by specialist recyclers.
