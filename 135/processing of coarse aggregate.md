The aggregate is the base material for concrete and provides bulk (70-80% of cement concrete volume is coarse aggregate). It limits the shrinkage of cement concrete upon drying. The coarse and fine aggregate mixture is used as a base and sub-base course in road construction. The coarse aggregate mixed with bitumen is used in wearing coats of roads.

For example coarse aggregate has a standard grading requirement for each different size from #1 to #8. A #1 aggregate is a nominal size of 3 ½ to 1 ½ inches and a #8 aggregate is a nominal size of 3/8 to 0.094 inch. More specifically, a #57 aggregate is the combination of #5 and #7 aggregates ranging from 1 to 0.19 inch.
