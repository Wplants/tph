## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
The Pilbara region is rich in such hematite ore, known also as "direct shipping ore" (DSO). DSO passes through a simple crushing, screening, and blending process (beneficiation) before it is shipped for steel production. DSOs, when mined, typically have iron (Fe) content of between 56% and 64% Fe.
