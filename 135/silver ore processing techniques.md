## How silver is made - material, making, history, used, processing, industry
Silver was first obtained in sixteenth-century Mexico by a method called the patio process. It involved mixing silver ore, salt, copper sulphide, and water. The resultant silver chloride was then picked up by adding mercury.  1 Silver ore is crushed into pieces, usually with 1-1.5 in (2.5-3.75 cm) diameters, to make the material porous

## silver ore processing techniques
The ore containing silver needs to be refined to obtain pure silver as an end product. The silver precipitate obtained previously may contain some impurities and so the impure silver is purified by the electrolytic method. The process requires a block of impure metal to be the anode while a thin strip of pure silver is fetched as cathode.

Silver (Ag), like gold, crystallizes in the face-centred cubic system. It melts when heated to 962° C (1,764° F). With a density of 10.49 grams per cubic centimeter, it is the lightest of the precious metals. It is also the least noble of the precious metals, reacting readily with many common reagents such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

Beyond this basic skill stands a long list of specialized techniques and tools for finishing a piece. Small pieces like handles and spouts are often cast using a lost-wax or sandcasting process, then fit and later soldered to the piece.

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.
