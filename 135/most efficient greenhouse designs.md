## Deep Winter Greenhouses | UMN Extension
A Deep Winter Greenhouse (DWG) is a greenhouse designed to limit the amount of fossil fuel it takes to grow crops during cold winters. DWGs are passive-solar greenhouses that rely on energy from the sun to heat the building instead of more traditional heating sources. There are a few important aspects of the design that make this possible.

In a bitterly cold climate, a geothermal greenhouse is the only cost-effective way to grow food all winter long. Most people use water circulation kept warm far below the surface to heat a structure, but there's a little known method that uses only air. One that University of Nebraska scientists said would never work back in 1979.
