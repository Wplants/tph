## Risk assessment of Flyrock in Surface Mines using a FFTA-MCDM Combination
The drilling and blasting method is the first choice for rock breakage in surface or underground mines due to its high flexibility against variations and low investment costs. However, any method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The flyrock phenomenon is one of the drilling and blasting disadvantages that the mining engineers have always been faced with in the surface mine blasting

Open-pit mining provides significant proportions of many of the world's major mineral commodities. Much of the world's annual output of copper, gold and iron ore is won from open-pit operations. Other commodities produced from open-pits include diamonds, molybdenum, manganese, lead and zinc, uranium and a variety of industrial minerals, such as borates, talc and specialist clays.

Coal Mining Risk Assessments. Coal mining took place historically throughout vast areas of central Scotland, where coal is found close to surface and at depth. This has left a legacy of unstable ground due to collapse of shallow workings and shafts. Polluted mine-water and mine gas can also be significant hazards where land has been undermined.
