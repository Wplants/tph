In addition to being safe and efficient, precision surface mining methods are helping miners create better sustainability practices. The vibrations caused by blasting can damage nearby infrastructure, including roads, utility lines, pipelines and buildings. To avoid this, mines are forced to abandon areas within close proximity to these obstacles.

On a mining site, you have two main options: Drill and blast with explosives and size the rock with a primary crusher, or use a continuous surface mining (CSM) method. In most cases, the material being produced by a CSM is in a consistent range with few fines and can be fed directly into a secondary crusher if needed.
