## Thermal Power Plants: Components & Working Principle
Working Principle of a Thermal Plant. The working fluid is water and steam. This is called feed water and steam cycle. The ideal Thermodynamic Cycle to which the operation of a Thermal Power Station closely resembles is the RANKINE CYCLE. In a steam boiler, the water is heated up by burning the fuel in the air in the furnace, and the function

## Combined Cycle Power Plant | GE Gas Power
Combined cycle power plant: how it works. A combined-cycle power plant uses both a gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50% more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power. Tour a combined cycle power plant.

This raises the possibility that power plant developers will continue to follow the pattern of the 1990s and rely heavily on natural gas plants to meet the need for new generating capacity.! With current technology, coal-fired power plants using carbon capture equipment are an expensive source of electricity in a carbon control case.

The power plant's net efficiency is simply the heat content of electricity (3600 kJ/kWh) divided by the heat rate (kJ/kWh) (see Equation 2). (2) The power plant's heat rate depends on the fuel type used and the specific power plant design. All the heat put into the plant that is not converted into electricity has to be dissipated somehow to the
