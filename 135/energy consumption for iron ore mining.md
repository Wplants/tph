## The Benefits of Recycling vs. Extracting Raw Metal｜Calgary
It requires various machines for mining and refining raw materials, while recycling has considerably fewer energy costs. Energy is roughly 30% of primary aluminum production costs, while aluminum scrap uses 5% of the energy during production. Besides lower energy costs, scrap metal recycling can be even more efficient than mining .

##  Iron Ore Quality a Potential Headwind to Green Steelmaking - IEEFA
The availability of DR-grade iron ore is a potential challenge to the global expansion of DRI technology. Among options to address this issue is a significant switch in iron ore mining focus from hematite towards magnetite. Magnetite ores tend to have a much lower Fe content but are often suitable for significant beneficiation, in part

## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.
