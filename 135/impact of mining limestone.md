## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining. It is the easiest way to remove the limestone without causing much destruction. In surface mining or open pit mining, the top soil and the overburden covering the mineral is removed. Then by the process of drilling the rocks or

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep
