## The Hidden Environmental Toll of Mining the World's Sand
Sand mining is the world's largest mining endeavor, responsible for 85 percent of all mineral extraction. It is also the least regulated, and quite possibly the most corrupt and environmentally destructive.  where it forms part of the gritty mixture injected underground to fracture shale deposits and release natural gas or oil.

The mined materials from underground are either transported to the surface via trucks or via cable belt to be delivered to the processing plant.

Mining now proceeds underground, underneath the open pit. At first, both a raise and a network of tunnels are made.

Surface mining. Surface mining（ground mining） is a type of mining in which the soil and rock covering the mineral deposit are removed instead of underground mining, in which the overlying stones are left in place. Surface miner machine（surface mining machines） is essential. The surface mining process is very complicated.

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Techniques in Underground Mining - ILO Encyclopaedia
The Underground Mine. The underground mine is a factory located in the bedrock inside the earth in which miners work to recover minerals hidden in the rock mass. They drill, charge and blast to access and recover the ore, i.e., rock containing a mix of minerals of which at least one can be processed into a product that can be sold at a profit.

## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
These methods include quarrying, open-pit mining, and strip mining. In quarrying, miners may cut blocks of hard stone for ornamental purposes, such as granite for building. However, quarrying can also refer to extracting gravel, crushed stone, and sand using similar techniques to open-pit mining.

This dam was made in the shape of a circular arch on its side, the arch being 6 ft. thick and having a radius of 7 ft. 6 in. On the crowning side of the arch, concrete to a thickness of 5 ft. was laid to act as a sealing device while the stone arch provided the necessary strength. Local sandstone was used in the construction of the arch.
