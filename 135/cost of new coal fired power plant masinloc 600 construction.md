## Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
1.1 Overview. Nearly 50% of the electricity generated in the world uses coal as the primary fuel. The function of the coal-fired thermal power plant is to convert the energy available in the coal to electricity. Coal power plants work by using several steps to convert stored energy in coal to usable electricity.
