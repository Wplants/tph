## iron mining impact on environment
However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. It degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water quality, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs. Iron ore tailings usually contain large amount of Silica, iron, and traces of Hg, Se, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn etc.

## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

The Iron Mountain Mine or Richmond Mine's 4,400-acre land has been mined for many resources such as iron, copper, gold, silver, and zinc for more than 100 years until mining operations halted in 1963. Even after mining in the Richmond mine was stopped, the mining activities have left the mountain fractured.

Mining is defined as an environmentally hazardous activity according to Swedish laws. Environmental impacts of mines occur in different ways, primarily via the discharge into surrounding underground water or streams and lakes at the surface of runoff water from the mine and water used in mineral processing which will be charged with mined metals and other elements.
