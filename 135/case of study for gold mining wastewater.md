##  Sedimentation Tests of Small Scale Gold Mining Wastewater
In this study, sedimentation tests were conducted to investigate the removal of suspended solids and heavy metals (As, Hg, Pb) from actual small scale gold mining (SSGM) wastewater gathered from SSGM area in Paracale, Camarines Norte using settling column. A glass column with a diameter of 7.5 cm and a height of 120 cm was used to determine the

Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.
