Reduction ratio is inversely proportional to the hammer mill sieve size. due to decrease in sieve size, the reduction increased rapidly. this shows the extent of grinding and by using lower sieve size in hammer mill finest particle can obtain. in the reduction ratio is very high compared to hammer mill because average particle size is very less.

## Hammermill Crushers | McLanahan
Reduction ratio is often measured by dividing the F80 by the P80. The F80 is the particle size where 80% of the feed material is smaller than that size. The P80 represents a particle size where 80% of the product is smaller. Reduction ratios will vary with each application within each family of Hammermills and by the amount of applied energy.
