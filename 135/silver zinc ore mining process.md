6.1 Process Overview 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist.

## zinc processing | Britannica
zinc processing, the extraction of zinc from its ores and the preparation of zinc metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. Zinc (Zn) is a metallic element of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure and a density of 7.13 grams per cubic centimetre. It has only moderate hardness and can be made ductile and easily worked at temperatures slightly above the ambient.

The reaction of the final step of extraction of zinc is. 2 Z n O + C â†’ 2 Z n + C O 2. Since the boiling point of zinc is way back at 1180 K, the zinc formed immediately vaporises and distils over leaving behind non-volatile impurities such as cadmium, lead and iron. This gas containing zinc vapours is collected and cooled to yield solid zinc.

## Silver Lead Zinc Ore Processing Method using Flotation
Also, the recovery of silver minerals occurring in a lead, zinc sulfide ore is efficiently accomplished using Flowsheet #2. The process consists of selective flotation to produce a mixed silver, lead concentrate for maximum smelter return and a separate zinc concentrate. Over-grinding of silver minerals is detrimental to efficient flotation
