Dry tamp vs. wet cast stone. The biggest difference between wet cast and dry cast stone is water content and the amount of slump (an industry term for how workable and pliable a synthetic stone mix is). Like its name implies, wet cast involves significantly more water than dry tamp, and because of that, wet cast exhibits 3 to 4 inches of slump.
