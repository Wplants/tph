## Pebble Crushing Circuit Design - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
It is important to construct a by-pass system, usually through a flop gate and chute, so that pebbles can be recycled directly to the primary mill feed in the event of a maintenance shut down for the crusher. The primary mill would then operate at reduced throughput and circuit availability would be enhanced.
