## aggregate crushing value test
The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.

## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in  - ReadCivil
Calculation of aggregate crushing value. The aggregate crushing value is defined as the ratio of the weight of fines passing through specified IS (here 2.36mm sieve) to the total weight of sample expressed in percentage. W1= Weigh of the total aggregates (Wa-We) W2= Weigh of aggregates passing through 2.36mm IS sieve.
