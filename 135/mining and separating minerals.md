The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

The separation is done in a separating funnel in a temperature controlled room of 20°C. The "heavy" grains will accumulate in the bottom of the funnel above the pinch clip and the "lighter" grains float to the surface. After 6 - 8 hours of separation the pinch clip is opened and the heavy minerals are drained onto a filter paper.

## How Are Minerals Mined - Realonomics
How Are Minerals Mined? The rock is drilled and blasted then moved to the surface by truck belt conveyor or elevator. Once at the surface the material is sent to a mill to separate the ore from the waste rock. . In a surface mine hard rock must be drilled and blasted although some minerals are soft enough to mine without blasting.

Once you have the deed numbers, you look up the individual deeds and determine whether mineral rights have ever been severed or withheld. If they have been severed, a separate mineral deed should be referenced. You will need to track down the transaction history. Each transaction will have its own deed, so you go back transaction by transaction.

## What is chemical separation in mining?
Similarly, you may ask, how are minerals separated? A successful separation of a valuable mineral from its ore can be determined by heavy-liquid testing, in which a single-sized fraction of a ground ore is suspended in a liquid of high specific gravity. Particles of less density than the liquid remain afloat, while denser particles sink.
