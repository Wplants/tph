It is harder and more resistant to stains than granite.Crushed quartzite is sometimes used in road construction. High purity quartzite is used to produce ferrosilicon, industrial silica sand, silicon and silicon carbide. During the Paleolithic quartzite was used, in addition to flint, quartz, and other lithic raw materials, for making stone tools.

## Quartzite - Formation, Composition, Properties, and Uses
Quartzite (from German Quarzit) forms when quartz sandstones are metamorphosed. The term quartzite also implies its high quartz content. Most quartzites contain 90% quartz by volume, but the percentage can go up to 99% in the case of the purest quartzite forms. Quartzite looks similar to its parent rock but it is much harder than sandstone.
