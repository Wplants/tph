Lead and Zinc Lead and zinc ores are usually found together with gold and silver. A lead-zinc ore may also contain lead sulfide, zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, iron carbonate, and quartz.  Flotation is the usual mineral separation or concentration process of choice. In flotation, workers use slurry reagents to float the heavy mineral away from

Sulfide-ammonium salt flotation method. This method is also one of the main methods for flotation of lead-zinc oxide ore. Its principle is similar to the sulfide-xanthate flotation method. After surface vulcanization of lead-zinc oxide ore, amine collectors are used to flotate lead-zinc oxide. This method requires attention to the influence of

Set the gold ore and a small quantity of lead in a cupel. Place the cupel in a blast furnace. Heat the mixture until the lead and gold ore liquefy. The blast furnace batters the cupel with hot air. The lead combines with other metals and forms oxide compounds that separate from the gold. This process works best with small quantities of gold ore.
