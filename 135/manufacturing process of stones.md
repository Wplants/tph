## Improvement of the manufacturing process of abrasive stones for honing 
Stones are made by the sintering process of abrasive grains, a metallic bond, and a humectant that favors covering of each abrasive grain by the bond. Incorrect mixing of abrasive grains with the bond and humectant can result in stones with nonuniform abrasive grain distribution. As the abrasive stone wears out, grain distribution will vary and
