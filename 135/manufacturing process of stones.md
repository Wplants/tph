Stones are made by the sintering process of abrasive grains, a metallic bond, and a humectant that favors covering of each abrasive grain by the bond. Incorrect mixing of abrasive grains with the bond and humectant can result in stones with nonuniform abrasive grain distribution. As the abrasive stone wears out, grain distribution will vary and

## Manufacturing Paper Products From Stone
The main reason why we need to pulverize our stone is that when we use large pieces of stone, it will result in low yield and high wastage during the manufacturing process. When we pulverize our stones, we will get a large number of sizes ranging from 0 to 100 microns and each size has its specific function in the manufacturing paper products.
