The old system of placer mining was employed. The flume, or sluice box, was about two miles in length and about two feet in width; the riffles were made of poles, originally five inches in diameter, but they were worn down rapidly.

## Non-Motorized In-Stream Placer Mining - Oregon
In response to this legislation, the Department of State Lands substantially revised our GA for placer mining.

The eligibility requirements, covered activities, and conditions of the GA have also changed.
