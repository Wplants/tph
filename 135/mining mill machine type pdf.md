The process of milling is capable of producing flat, angled or curved surfaces (or a combination thereof), depending on the type(s) of tool(s) being used and the sophistication and type of the milling machine. Milling machines are referred to as 3-axis machines when the table can move in the x and y directions and the tool in the z-direction.

## What is Milling Machine?- Parts, Operation, Diagram
A milling machine is a machine tool that cuts metal as the workpiece is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The milling cutter rotates at a very high speed because of the multiple cutting edges, it cuts the metal at a very fast rate. This machine can also hold single or multiple cutters at the same time.
