## process of silica sand
Silica sand consists of well-rounded, sand composed of almost pure quartz grains. Quartz, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), is the most common mineral found on the Earth's surface and is found in rocks like granite, gneiss, and sandstone. The value of silica sand can be significantly higher than sand and gravel used in the con- struction industry.
