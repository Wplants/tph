Milling is the machining process in which the removal of metal takes place due to the cutting action of a rotating milling cutter.In a milling machine, the cutter is rotating due to workpiece is fed against it.This machine can hold more than one tool at a time. The cutter rotates at high speed, and because of the many cutting edges, it removes metal at a very fast rate.

On a vertical mill, the rotary cutting head has a vertical alignment, causing the spindle to move up and down along the Z-axis while the machine is in operation. As the spindle moves, the cutters work to remove material as the rest of the machine moves and shifts along the X-axis and Y-axis to continuously position the object for further cutting.

## Vertical Mill | For A Bodies Only Mopar Forum
If head work was on the menu for the mill, I would be holding out for a 10x50 table machine. More room for fixturing and you can get to each end of the head with some table travel left. You need to be able to swing a big facing mill to do a head in one pass and it should go all the way off each end so you need all the Y-travel you can get.

But milling work can generate considerable force - for example, plunging in with a slot-drill. With the VMS and the work some distance behind the swivel disc, this force combined with leverage might cause the disc to slip and turn. I suppose a bolt through the back of the adaptor plate into a tapped hole in the cross-slide would cure this.

VMC Machine Motion. CNC machines use a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Figure 10. shows a typical Vertical Milling Center (VMC). Parts to be machined is fastened to the machine table. This table moves in the XY-Plane. As the operator faces the machine, the X-Axis moves the table left-right. The Y-Axis moves the table forward-backward.
