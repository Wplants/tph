## A Low-Cost Novel Talc-Based Opaque Glaze for Ceramic Floor Tiles
Zirconium silicate (ZrSiO 4) is widely used commercially as an opacifying agent in the ceramic tile industry.But due to the high price of ZrSiO 4, its alternatives are being discovered. In this research, a novel approach of replacing zirconium silicate with talc [Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2] in ceramic floor tile glaze has been investigated to make the glaze cost effective.

Uses. » Zirconium resists corrosion, and hence, it is used as an alloying agent in materials that often come in contact with corrosive agents. Some of these materials are used as surgical appliances, vacuum tube getters, and filaments or explosive primers. » Being heat-resistant, the alloys of zirconium are employed in space vehicles.

Where is zirconia made? Zircon, also referred to as zirconium silicate (ZrSiO 4), is a co-product from the mining and processing of ancient heavy mineral sand deposits.Mined mainly in Australia and South Africa, zircon can be used either in its coarse sand form or milled to a fine powder.. Is zirconium harmful to humans? Zirconium has very low toxicity and it is estimated that humans ingest

Zircon. Zircon is a Zr-bearing silicate mineral (ZrSiO 4 ). It is very interesting and useful mineral in several ways. It is unique mineral because it is mined for several reasons. It is a principal source of zirconium and hafnium (it always contains small amount of Hf which replaces Zr) and contains yet smaller amounts of rare earth elements too.

Oregon and one in Utah. Zirconium and hafnium are typically contained in zircon at a ratio of about 36 to 1. Zirconium chemicals were produced by the metal producer in Oregon and by at least 10 other companies. Ceramics, foundry sand, opacifiers, and refractories are the leading end uses for zircon. Other end uses of zircon include abrasives,
