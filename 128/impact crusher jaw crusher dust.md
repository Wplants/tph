## Reduce dust pollution of jaw crusher-Jiaozuo zhongxin heavy industry
Oct 28, 2020As the first crushing equipment for ore mining, the working environment faced by jaw crushers is often harsh. Large amounts of ore will inevitably produce a large amount of dust during the crushing process, which will diffuse into the air with the airflow, which will not only cause serious environmental pollution., It will also cause certain harm to the staff's physical and mental health, so

In contrast, an impact crusher produces smaller materials that result in sizes of half a centimeter to 20 centimeters. Impact crushers can also bring out finer and more consistent shapes than a jaw crusher. It also produces more dust in the process.

Dec 20, 2021I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
