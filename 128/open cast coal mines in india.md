## EIA analysis of coal mining project - Centre for Science and Environment
According to the EIA report, open cast coal mining by JNL will involve breaching of the groundwater table. The depth of the groundwater table is as low as the 1.4 metres below ground level during the post-monsoon period, and even during the pre-monsoon period, the water table can be as low as 3 metres (page 45).

## Calculating coal waste volume in opencast mines
Step 1: Once pit design and reserve database reparation is complete, report the Coal and waste volume for all the seams irrespective of seam thickness. The Report will appear like this: Step 2: Now we need to mark the areas in the seam thickness grid, below and above the threshold value of seam thickness for mining, let's say 0.5m in this case.
