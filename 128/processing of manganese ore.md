## Manganese
This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.

Manganese fines. With their high manganese content, our fines have been developed for the production of silicomanganese (SiMn). This ore is used to improve process performance (less waste, reduced energy consumption), particularly in the production of agglomerates. Its low iron content makes it highly complementary to iron rich ores.

Hydrometallurgy is the most suitable extractive technique for the extraction and purification of manganese as compared to all other techniques including biometallurgy and pyrometallurgical processes. In the hydrometallurgical processing of manganese from its ore, the leach liquors often contain divalent ions such as iron, manganese, copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc along with other impurities

## From Ore Body to High Temperature Processing of Complex Ores: Manganese 
Manganese is considered a relatively rare metal as concentrations of it in ore of commercial importance are geographically limited. In nature, manganese is found in the form of oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Manganese ores are complex in the sense that they not only consist of a complex oxide mineral assemblage but these minerals are also very finely inter-grown. South Africa accounts for

Conspectus of Mineral Processing. Manganese Ore commonly includes pyrolusite(MnO2), psilomelane, manganite (Mn2O3H20). Theoretically, the high grade of pyrolusite can be to 63.19%, density 4.5-5.0. Manganese Ore has weak magnetism and usually it may dirty hands. It generally contains large amounts of silt.
