## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

Once the iron ore becomes magnetite, it is much easier to beneficiate & pelletise it. The efficiency of iron recovery is 90-95% (as against 70-75% in the conventional beneficiation plants) & the left-over Fe in the tailings is only 10-15% (as against 35-45% in the conventional beneficiation plants).
