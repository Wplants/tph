## 6 things you need to know about sand mining
Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Silica Sand for Water Filtration - YUNZE MINERAL
What is Silica Sand? Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed..
