## Why is hematite used over magnetite? Magnetite has more iron  - Quora
Answer (1 of 2): Hematite ore is simply mined, crushed, and after that screened into either lump or fines. It is then immediately sold as such. The ore has high iron content, typically between 56% and 64% Fe. Magnetite has higher iron content than hematite. But hematite ore usually contains larg

The deposit was discovered in 1844 and ore was first mined there in 1848, as per the State of Michigan's website. Among the four types of iron ore deposits found in this area are magnetite and hematite ore. In Minnesota, magnetite iron ore is mined mainly in the Mesabi iron range, one of the four ranges that make up the Iron Range of Minnesota.

## Magnetite
Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.

## High Quality price magnetite iron ore
The price magnetite iron ore available on the online store has great thermal shock resistance. It means a reduction of the lower fines formation in the furnace that increases levels of permeability. There is less dust during handling and transportation, meaning you will not lose a lot of the ore. That results in a lesser negative effect on the

## Magnetite - American Chemical Society
Magnetite is in the hexoctahedral crystal class; in the 3-D crystal structure, the purple atoms are iron, and the red atoms are oxygen. Magnetite's greatest use is as an important iron ore for steel manufacture. Other applications are as a catalyst in the Haber process for making ammonia, as a pigment for paints and ceramics, and as magnetic
