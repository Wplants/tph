## Iron Ore Tailing Beneficiation - a Potential Resource for Future
Iron ore tailing/slime (-150 m) is produced after scrubbing and wet screening of a low-grade iron ore. Tailing beneficiation of iron ore has been addressed either by flotation or wet high intensity high gradient separation. The present study aims to recover iron values from discarded slime containing assay ~56% Fe, ~6.5% SiO2, and ~7.0% Al2O3

As a typical refractory iron ore, the utilization of limonite ore with conventional mineral processing methods has great limitations. In this study, suspension magnetization roasting technology was developed and utilized to recover limonite ore. The influences of roasting temperature, roasting time, and reducing gas concentration on the magnetization roasting process were investigated. The

##  Mineralogy and Geochemistry of A Low Grade Iron Ore Sample from Bellary 
Hence, the present iron ore sample from Bellary-Hospet sector was studied megascopically. Study of the hand picked iron ore samples indicated that the ores can be grouped into three ore types. 1. Hard ore: Hard ore as the name indicates is a hard and compact ore of steel grey colour. 2. Flakey ore: Flakey ore which is of laminated type occur as

## Limonite Siderite Iron Ore Beneficiation
Apr 6, 2021Limonite. The limonite ore was the lowest in grade of all the limonitic ores investigated, with an iron content of 21.0 percent and an acid insoluble content of 53.5 percent. Like the other limonitic ores, it contained little ferrous iron,with only 3 percent of the total being in this reduced state.
