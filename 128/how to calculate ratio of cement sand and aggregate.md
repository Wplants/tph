## Cement Sand Aggregate Ratio in Concrete Mix | How to calculate?
Apr 15, 2022Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.

Calculating the aggregate quantity, Get the part of aggregate content in the concrete mix from the grade specified in fraction from. (Example, part of cement in grade M15 is 4/7 as ratio is 1:2:4). Multiply the same with the required dry volume of the concrete you will get the aggregate required in volume which has to be converted to weight.

## Portland cement mix ratio calculator
A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons, as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio . This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency. Water is not included in these ratios, though, because it can vary more.

Total Aggregate by cement ratio (A/C) decreases with increase in grade of concrete. For example, M20 grade of aggregate will have a higher A/C ratio than of M30. Higher the Aggregate/Cement ratio leaner the concrete mix, as cement content is lower. Concrete mix can be made more workable by fine tuning Aggregate/Cement ratio.

There are two main ways to design the concrete mix. Design mix method :- In this method, materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code . In this method, cement, sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight, and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.
