In three of our direct reduction plants, iron ore (oxide pellets or lump ore) is reduced using the Midrex technology. This is an energy-efficient process that uses natural gas reforming to produce the required reducing gases (CO and H2). Our newest DRI plant in Suez uses HYL technology by Danieli to produce high-quality feedstock.

## Direct Reduced Iron - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico.

The rate of decarbonisation would depend on how rapidly this modern technology could replace today's dominant blast furnace steel mills, which meet about 70% of global demand. Blast furnaces require coking coal for the reduction of iron ore as well as alloying of carbon to create the steel itself. In contrast, DRI can currently use methane.
