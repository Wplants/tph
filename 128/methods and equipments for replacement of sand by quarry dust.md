## Benefits of Quarry Dust in Construction - North Hills Co. Ltd.
Using quarry dust is environmentally friendly and available. Quarry dust is much more accessible and available than regular sand for construction. Regular sand is mined from the river bed but quarry dust is a by-product of stone chippings and a good replacement for sand. Using quarry dust saves the environment by preventing sand mining.
