## What is the critical path in project management? - InLoox
Activities that put the project end at risk. A critical path is a sequence of interdependent activities or tasks that must be finished before the project can be finished. It is the longest path (i.e. path with the longest duration) from project start to finish.At the same time, the longest path is the path that shows the minimal time in which a project can be completed.

## Critical Path vs Critical Chain: Concept, Differences, Examples
The critical path method (CPM) is a project management scheduling method. It defines the sequence in which specific activities are carried out to complete a project within a given time frame and budget. Action in the critical path cannot be delayed or shortened in duration, for the whole project to finish on time.
