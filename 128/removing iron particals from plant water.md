Iron, even in small quantities, can be one of the most troublesome elements found in water. As little as 0.3 ppm (parts per million) of iron can cause staining of fixtures, sinks, flooring, and also most anything else it comes into contact with. Concentrations below 0.3 ppm can still have profound adverse effects in manufacturing processes.

Origin of Iron Contamination in Water. Iron is one of the natural minerals abundantly available in the earth's crust. Also an inorganic chemical, about 5% of the earth's crust is made up of iron. The rainwater that infiltrates the soil and the underlying rock formations dissolves the iron present in the crust and causes it to seep into aquifers that serve as sources of groundwater.

An excessive amount of green growth or sediment in lakes and streams can make them inadmissible for diversion and aquatic life. Turbidity is caused by particles suspended or broke down in water that scatter light making the water seem shady or dinky. Turbidity is an indicator of health risk. Science has demonstrated that as turbidity increases

## How to remove Iron from Water with a Filter? | PB International
When the water enters the Iron Water Filter, it passes through compressed air. The water then passes through a membrane which separates the iron from the water. The insoluble partials of iron will stay behind into the membrane while the iron-free water passes through. Iron filters are maintained with periodic backwashing to remove the insoluble
