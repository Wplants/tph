How Is Limestone Used to Make Cement? | Reference. Limestone is one of the two key components required to make cement; the other is clay. To make cement powder, limestone and clay are ground into a powder, mixed together in the proper proportions and then fed into a rotary kiln, which heats the raw materials to around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is engineered with a higher limestone content than portland cement to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by about 10%. It performs just like the cement you're used to using, resulting in the same concrete you're used to having. The same specifications, the same mix design, now with a better carbon profile.

## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.
