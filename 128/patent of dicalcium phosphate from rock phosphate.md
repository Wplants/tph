## patent of dicalcium phosphate from rock phosphate
Bridger (US Letters Patent No 3,011,888) shows that dicalcium phosphate may be prepared, without the use of excess acid, by treating phosphate rock with water and phosphoric acid, curing the product (principally monocalcium phosphate and phosphate rock) at room temperature for several days, mixing it with more water and hydrolyzing the
