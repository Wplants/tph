The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

Iron Ore Statistics and InformationUSGS. Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron Fe. It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite Fe 3 O 4 and hematite Fe 2 O 3. Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
