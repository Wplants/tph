Ladle arc heating is a process used to ensure that the molten steel is at exactly the correct temperature for casting.  Any remaining sulphur can be removed through the use of alloying additions of manganese which reacts with the sulphur to form MnS.

The situation with aluminum is even more pronounced. The "identical" aluminum frame would be 1/3 as stiff as steel, roughly half as strong, and 1/3 the weight. Such a frame would be quite unsatisfactory. That's why aluminum frames generally have noticeably larger tubing diameters and thicker-walled tubing.
