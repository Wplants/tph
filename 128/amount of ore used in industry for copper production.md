According to the Superfund Research Program at the University of Arizona, copper ore can contain as little as 1% copper, and requires significant processing to turn it into pure (99.99%) copper. Throughout most of history, the only way to process copper ore was through smelting, or applying heat to the ore to extract impurities.

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper miners, lowered its carbon emissions by more than 21 percent from 2015 to 2019. This puts the company on track to meet the COP21 framework to limit global warming to below 2°C from pre-industrial levels by 2050.

Copper can be produced either pyrometallurgically or hydrometallurgically. The hydrometallurgical route is used only for a very limited amount of the world's copper production and normally only considered in connection to in-situ leaching of copper ores; from an environmental point of view this is a questionable production route.
