## What Are the Working Principles of Roll Forming Machines?
Aug 19, 2021The working principle of the roll forming machines is driven by a motor, the main shaft rotates through the transmission system, and is driven by a three-jaw chuck. The main movement of the rolling machine is the rotation of the workpiece, and the longitudinal feed movement and the radial feed movement are realized by the rolling head.
