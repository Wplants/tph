## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.

Mar 16, 2021 Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. These production improvements come from a number of engineering changes, but a large part is due to better crushing chamber design.

## Evaluation of size reduction process for rock aggregates in cone crusher
The crushability, grindability, and cutability of rocks are associated with many factors. During the size reduction processes in a jaw crusher and rod mill, crushing and grinding energy consumption increase when finer size fractions of the product are desired (Zeng and Forssberg 1992).Heikkilä (Heikkila 1991) reported that the lithological features affect the attrition typology of rocks in
