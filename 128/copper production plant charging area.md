## Zambia Copper Production To Slow From 2022 As Resource Nationalism 
Zambia's copper production will see a post Covid-19 recovery of 4.0% y-o-y in 2021. Over the long term, annual copper mine production growth will average 2.2% during . Zambia's resource nationalistic rhetoric will be a key deterrent for investment into copper mines going forward. As Zambia's debt situation remains uncertain, the government will continue to charge high taxes from

## Copper in plants | Cropaia
Its concentration in plant tissue ranges from 5 to 20 ppm and in soil from 2 to 100 ppm (mg kg -­ ). However, most of the copper in the soil is not available for plants. Availability of copper increases in soil pH below 7.0 and decreases at a higher pH, due to fixation to soil clay minerals. Copper tends to easily bind to organic matter.

The old traditional process is based on roasting, smelting in reverbatory furnaces or electric furnaces for more complex ores, producing matte and converting for production of blister copper which is further refined to cathode copper.

## CO₂ Emissions - Sustainable Copper
Copper mining firms worldwide are committed to reducing their carbon emissions. Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper miners, lowered its carbon emissions by more than 21 percent from 2015 to 2019. This puts the company on track to meet the COP21 framework to limit global warming to below 2°C from pre-industrial levels by 2050.
