Unlike a jaw crusher which uses compression between two large metal plates to break rocks down, and an impact crusher for sale works in a completely different way. They do break down larger blocks into much smaller ones, yet they can be much more versatile than a standard jaw crusher. They use the power of acceleration to break down the material.
