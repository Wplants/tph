## Portland Limestone Cement | Michigan Concrete
Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is engineered with a higher limestone content than portland cement to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by about 10%. It performs just like the cement you're used to using, resulting in the same concrete you're used to having. The same specifications, the same mix design, now with a better carbon profile.

Aim to break the limestone into pieces not larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm) across. 3. Cook the limestone in a kiln or outdoor oven. In order to ready the limestone for use in cement, place it in a kiln or outdoor wood oven. [4] Turn the kiln up to 900 °C (1,650 °F), and leave the limestone to "bake" for 4 or 5 hours.

## Explained: Cement vs. concrete - MIT Sustainability
Cement production begins with limestone, a sedimentary rock. Once quarried, it is mixed with a silica source, such as industrial byproducts slag or fly ash, and gets fired in a kiln at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. What comes out of the kiln is called clinker. Cement plants grind clinker down to an extremely fine powder and mix in a few additives.
