The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

Abstract: The copper oxide ore is high oxidation ratio and the high combination ratio with a low grade of Cu 0.71%. Copper concentrate of Cu 15.02% with a recovery of 38.55% was obtained by flotation. The optimum acid leaching conditions were investigated. Effects of lixiviant concentration, solid-to-liquid ratio, leaching time were investigated.

## Copper Concentrate | AMERICAN ELEMENTS
Copper concentrate is similar to powder in that it is made up of minute, dry particles of pure substance. Concentrate is also useful in any application where high surface areas are desired such as water treatment and in fuel cell and solar applications. Nanoparticles also produce very high surface areas. Our standard Concentrate particle sizes
