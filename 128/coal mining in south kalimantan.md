## Deadly Coal - coal exploitation and Kalimantan's blighted generation 
South Kalimantan is the second largest coal producer in Indonesia, and yet almost every day parts of the province suffer power cuts. Provincial energy needs of 270MW remain modest compared to the amount of energy being exported from the province, but the state power company is 30 MW short of this amount and 21,000 people are waiting to get

Abstract: Open pit mining that commonly implemented in Indonesia has caused ecosystem damage, soil degradation, pollution, water sedimentation, and change of climates. A coal mining site in Asam-asam Villange, South Kalimantan happens the same way. The supporting capacity of topsoil post-mining activities left the area into low grade soil for the

The smallest coal bunker will normally hold about 150kg which is equivalent to 3 bags of coal. The next size up will normally hold between 250 and 300kg which is about 5 or 6 bags. The larger coal bunkers will hold between 400 and 500 kg which is between 8 or 10 bags of coal. Ideally you would want to keep enough fuel to last you comfortably.

So much so that the principle of good mining practice is the main foundation in the management of South Kalimantan," said Dharma at the conference. With a current production capacity, the estimated life of the coalmines in South Kalimantan is 30 years.
