To calculate how much gravel you need to cover a rectangular area you need to multiply the volume by the gravel density. The volume formula for a rectangular (or square) box in cubic feet is height (ft) x width (ft) x length (ft), as seen in the figure below: For example, to fill a box with a width of 3ft and a length of 6ft, to a depth of 1ft

Step one is establishing the volume of gravel needed. It is equal to the volume of an excavation, and you can do it in the following way: Determine the length and width of a cuboidal excavation. In our example the excavation length is l = 6 yd and the width is b = 3 yd.; Calculate the area of the excavation, multiplying the length and width together. In our case, A = 6  3 = 18 yd².
