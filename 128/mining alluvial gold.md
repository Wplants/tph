Placer Gold Mining Methods. The gold deposits grouped together under the name of " placers " comprise sands, gravels, or any loosely coherent or non-coherent alluvial beds containing gold. They have accumulated owing to the action of running water, in the beds of rivers, or on the adjoining inundation plains, or on sea beaches.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Alluvial gold mining and trade in Nineteenth-Century South Central 
6 In some areas, alluvial gold was worked by shafts sunk into river banks and reef mining may have developed from this technique; see, for example, The Rhodesian Mining Review, 19 02 1913, 185. For further details of alluvial mining methods, see I. R. Phimister, 'Placer mining in South Central Africa', unpub. research paper.Google Scholar
