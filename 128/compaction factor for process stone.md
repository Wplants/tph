## Vibro Stone Columns - Ground Developments
The process. Vibro Stone Columns are constructed using a vibrating mandrel which is used to penetrate the ground to a designed depth. This creates a void which is filled with inert granular material in stages whilst compaction continues. The result is an interaction between the stone column and the surrounding soils.

## Soil compaction | UMN Extension - University of Minnesota
What is compaction? Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, reducing pore space between them (Figure 1). Heavily compacted soils contain few large pores, less total pore volume and, consequently, a greater density. A compacted soil has a reduced rate of both water infiltration and drainage. This happens because large pores more effectively move water downward through

Effect of Water Content on Compaction of Soil. At low water content, the soil is stiff and offers more resistance to compaction. As the water content is increased, the soil particles get lubricated. The soil mass becomes more workable and the particles have closer packing. The dry density of the soil increases with an increase in the water

The process of compaction decreases the likelihood of settlement after a building, roadway, runway or parking lot is constructed. Settlement could result in premature pavement failure, costly maintenance or repairs.  Factors, such as soil type, moisture level, lift thickness and the type of compactor are also important.

Factors affecting Compaction of soil. Compaction of the soil is the process where the dry density of soil is increased by reducing air content or air voids present in the soil. This process is an essential part of the construction of any structure, as it strengthens the soil. Many factors influence the degree with which the soil is compacted.
