To do this, take the total cost of your project, as outlined by your builder, and divide this by the total number of square feet in your project. For example, if your new home is to be 2,000 square feet and your builder estimated that it would cost $350,000 to build, then your cost per square foot is 300,000 divided by 2,000, or $175.

Approx Cost and Time required for 75 construction.
