Description. Petroleum coke (often abbreviated Pet coke or petcoke) is a carbonaceous solid derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes.Other coke has traditionally been derived from coal. This coke can either be fuel grade (high in sulphur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulphur and metals). The raw coke directly out of the coker is often referred to as green coke.

## Calcined Pet Coke - Dev Energy
Calcined Pet Coke. Calcined Petroleum Coke (CPC) is manufactured from Raw Petroleum Coke (RPC) by the process known as high temperature pyrolysis. The process is carried out in a rotary or vertical kiln at temperatures exceeding 1300 deg C. Calcination of CPC is essentially a high temperature treatment in which the carbon to hydrogen ratio of
