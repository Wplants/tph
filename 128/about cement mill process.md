##  Process Control for Cement Grinding in Vertical Roller Mill (Vrm) a Review
The power ingesting of a grinding process is 50-60% in the cement production power consumption. The Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) reduces the power consumption for cement grinding approximately 30-40% associated with other grinding mills. The process variables in cement grinding process using VRM are strongly nonlinear and having large time

## Cement Manufacturing Process - All About Engineering
In the process of manufacturing cement, the first step is the crushing of raw materials. These raw materials contain limestone and clay or shale. Usually, the material is crushed in a tube mill. In the tube mill, there are steel balls. This process can be done in wet or dry conditions depending on the product in use but in dry process, the

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
