## Copper: Helpful or Harmful for Plant Health? - Roots Shoots & Fruits
Once the chelated copper is inside of the plant, the shell comes off and the copper is released to do its work. Copper chelates do not have the fungicidal property that copper salts have. There are several materials that can be used as chelators to make a shell around copper. A common chelating agent is an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide

Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.

Plant your copper leaf in organically rich soil that has been amended with compost. Copper plant fast growing heavy feeder, so it will grow best with good soil from the start. Allow each plant a 3 foot area to grow and fill into. This plant needs plenty of elbow room to grow healthy and well. Copper plant loves water.

## Frontiers | Copper Trafficking in Plants and Its Implication on Cell 
In plants, copper (Cu) acts as essential cofactor of numerous proteins. While the definitive number of these so-called cuproproteins is unknown, they perform central functions in plant cells. As micronutrient, a minimal amount of Cu is needed to ensure cellular functions. However, Cu excess may exert in contrast detrimental effects on plant primary production and even survival. Therefore it is

8. Copper occurs in three different types of mineral-tions - sulfides, carbonates and silicates. Sulfides are by far the most important and silicates are the least important. Sulfides consist of copper, sulfur and iron. Since copper metal is more easily extracted from the carbenate and sulfide minerals,
