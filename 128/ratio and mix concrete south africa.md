## Actual Concrete Mix Ratios For 3000, 3500, 4000, and 4500 psi concrete
Rounded off it's basically a 1 : 3 : 3 mix ratio. If I break the weights down per yard of concrete it comes to: 1. Cement = 510.75 pounds. 2. Stone = 1658.75 pounds. 3. Sand = 1496.25 pounds. A sack or "bag" of cement weighs 94 pounds so this tells us a 3000 psi concrete mix is also equal to a 5.5 sack mix of concrete.

When you get your mixing rations correct, remember to only add the amount of water needed to combine the mix, if you add more water (common problem) this will decrease the strength of the finished product. This is usually 2 - 2.5 liters of clean water per 20kg of mix. 29th Jan 2015, 07:31 AM. shauck.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons, as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio. This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency. Water is not included in these ratios, though, because it can vary more

The Mix ratio produces a plastic, easy-working, cohesive mortar of plastering consistence. Water reducing admixtures are used to decrease water used in the mix to prevent drying shrinkage.  Our 4:1 Concrete screed mix can be pumped with a boom or stationary pump, this needs to be arranged when ordered as the mix design is slightly different

## Mix Ratio of Sand-Cement Screed for Floors - The Constructor
It is reported that, for traditional screeds a mix proportion of 1:6 Portland cement: sand/aggregate is a normal range that is commonly used. However, mix proportions of 1:4 cement to sand is widely applied which comply with British Standard (BS12). Mix ratio should produce a plastic, easy-working, cohesive mortar of plastering consistence.
