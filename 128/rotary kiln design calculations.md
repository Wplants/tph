DIRECT ROTARY DRYERS Direct rotary dryers are the most common choice of equipment for drying bulk solids. These robust industrial dryers offer heavy-duty construction, efficient processing, and uniform results, even when working with variance in feedstock.

## Cement Kilns: Design features of rotary kilns
The early commercially successful rotary kilns in Britain were nearly all "straight" cylinders, the exceptions being those at Norman (1904). Lengthening of the early kilns at Wouldham and Bevans resulted in kilns with enlarged burning zones, while the lengthened kilns at Swanscombe had enlargements at both ends. Among new installations from 1909 to 1914, only 15 out of 44 were "straight", the

Rotary calciners, also commonly called indirect kilns, are used in various calcination operations where exhaust gases must be minimized, when processing finely divided solids, or where temperature must be tightly controlled along the length of the kiln. A calciner is comprised of a rotating drum inside a furnace, which is externally heated.
