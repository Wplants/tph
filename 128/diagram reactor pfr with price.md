## Plug_flow_reactor_model
The plug flow reactor (PFR) model is used to describe chemical reactions in continuous, flowing systems.The PFR model is used to predict the behaviour of chemical reactors, so that key reactor variables, such as the dimensions of the reactor, can be estimated.PFRs are also sometimes called as Continuous Tubular Reactors (CTRs).

## Plug flow reactor model
The plug flow reactor model (PFR, sometimes called continuous tubular reactor, CTR, or piston flow reactors) is a model used to describe chemical reactions in continuous, flowing systems of cylindrical geometry. The PFR model is used to predict the behavior of chemical reactors of such design, so that key reactor variables, such as the dimensions of the reactor, can be estimated.

## Effect of Tube Diameter on Plug Flow Reactor
A first-order, exothermic reaction takes place in a plug flow reactor (PFR) that has pressure drop and heat transfer through the walls. Use the slider to observe the effects of changing reactor diameter; the total feed flow rate is kept constant by changing the number of parallel reactors (number of equivalent reactors) so that the total reactor cross section does not change.

Batch Reactor In the batch reactor, or BR the reactants are initially charged into a container, are well mixed, and are left to react for a certain period. The resultant mixture is then discharged. This is an unsteady-state operation where composition changes with time. 3. Plug flow reactor â¢ In the PFR thr flow of fluid through the reactor

The third general type of reactor is the Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). In a plug flow reactor, nutrients (and sometimes organisms) are introduced to the reactor continuously and move through the reactor as a "plug".

The contents in the PFR flow like plugs, from inlet to outlet. On the other hand, the reaction mixture is well mixed, just like that in a batch reactor, within each plug, or on the cross-section plane of the PFR. This idealization makes the flow reactor analysis simplified extremely as now one can treat the PFR as a one-dimensional flow reactor.

We wish to design two ideal continuous-flow reactors in series to achieve 80% conversion. These reactors may be of the same type (CSTR or PFR) or two different types (PFR and CSTR). Determine the best two reactors that will result in the lowest total volume, and calculate the volume of each.
