Estimating compressive strength. General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0.
