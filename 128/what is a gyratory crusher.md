## How do a gyratory crusher work?
A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head with both the surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel liners. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but it does not rotate. The movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.

## Gyratory Crusher - Mining Fundamentals
A gyratory crusher is an ore processing machine that crushes the ore between an eccentrically mounted cone and a crushing throat that is fixed. In mining, the most important criteria for effective crushing of oresis to choose the type of crusher that suits the rock (ore) material and to ensure uniform feed.

Types of Crushers Gyratory Crushers. The gyratory crusher consists of a wide opening that has a conical shaped mid section leading down to a narrow bottom. Using the center element to rotate and gyrate about its fulcrum, the rock is broken due to the motion of the centerpiece in relation to the outer shell (advance and retreat).

The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher, the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore, primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

gyratory crusher working principle animation. image credit by 911 Metallurgist. Similar to a jaw crusher, the gyratory crusher pulverizers the stones by placing them between two manganese steel plates and going straight down. It does not rotate, rather it is powered by electricity. Gyratory crushers are used in mine or ore processing plants and

## What is the eccentric throw? â€” SRP
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on the concave, material is
