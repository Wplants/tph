## Black Sand Concentrates
Black sand concentrates are what you end up with after first processing of your gold bearing material. It is usually a combination of minerals in the iron group: Hematite, Fe3o3, with a specific gravity of 5.26, an iron mineral that is non-magnetic and Magnetite, Fe3o4, with a specific gravity of 5.20, is magnetic.

The estimated global consumption of sand and gravel is around 50 billion tons per year. And sand mining alone is a $70 billion (US) industry. So sand has become an increasingly important and valuable resource over the years as the demand for it in the global construction industry grows and its availability declines.

In black sand beaches in the Philippines, a type of valuable iron ore called magnetite abounds. However, black sand mining often takes place illegally, which increases the risks and magnitude of threats, such as gradual or sudden land subsidence which as a result of erosion, exposes the coastal communities to rising sea levels and typhoons.

Abstract. Being a solid, sand can sustain shear stresses at rest but it can also undergo large plastic deformations without considerable change of its properties, behaving thus like a fluid. As a product of erosion, sand cannot be broken into parts because it is already a broken ('clastic') material. The pronounced deformability of sand
