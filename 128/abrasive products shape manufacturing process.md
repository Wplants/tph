## The Manufacturing Process: Steps & Types - ProjectManager
Manufacturing is the production of a product by processing raw materials. This is accomplished through human labor, the use of machinery and/or other tools and often a biological or chemical process. Manufacturing can be on a large scale, or it can make the pieces that are assembled to build automobiles, airplanes, household appliances and more.

Apr 23, 2021Grinding wheels can be prepared with complex forms for finishing 3D-printed Inconel 718 and titanium 6-4 parts. Using a grinding process with a pre-formed wheel is an effective way to finish a relatively large batch of parts. In addition to precision grinding, abrasive tools can also be used for free-form finishing in manual or robotic mode.

The most important abrasive product manufactured is the grinding wheel. Made of abrasive grain and a binder, or "bond," it is a self-sharpening cutting tool. As the grains on the periphery become dull, they are shed from the surface of the grinding wheel, and fresh, sharp cutting edges are exposed. The ability to resharpen is controlled by

## How grinding wheel is made - material, history, used, parts, components 
If selected correctly, an abrasive chosen to shape a particular substance will retain its friability when ground against that substance: because the grinding will cause the abrasive to continue fracturing along clean, sharp lines, it will maintain a sharp edge throughout the grinding process.

The simplest manufacturing process for producing silicon carbide is to combine silica sand and carbon in an Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace at a high temperature, between 1600°C (2910°F) and 2500°C (4530°F). Fine silicon particles can be converted to silicon carbide (SiC) by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material.
