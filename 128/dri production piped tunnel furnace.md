## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

Instead of sinter, the DRI process uses pelletised iron ore. But just like sinter, it still has to have the oxygen removed. This process is known as 'reducing'. Instead of coke, the energy source used in the DRI furnace is natural gas. Again, the result is liquid iron. From the DRI furnace, the iron moves to the electric arc furnace on conveyors.

## DRI production in India - Steel Times International
DRI production in India. India produced 22Mt DRI in 2011, a drop of 1.45Mt (7%) from 2010 but the country still remains the world's largest producer by a wide margin. India's drop in production was a result of several economic factors. First, there was a slowing of the general economic growth that has been developing for years.

DRI production with syngas. The gas based direct reduction (DR) process is designed to convert iron pellet/lump into metallic iron by the use of reducing gases in a solid-gas moving bed shaft furnace. O2 is removed from the iron ore by chemical reactions based on H2 and CO for the production of highly metallized DRI.
