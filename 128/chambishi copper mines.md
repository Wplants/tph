The United States reopened its Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, which went bankrupt in 2017. The mine produced 26,000 metric tons of light rare earth oxide in concentrate form in 2019 and accounted for 12 percent of global production, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey. This helped reduce China's dominance of the first-stage.
