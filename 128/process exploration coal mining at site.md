The second step of the mining process is the design and planning of mine site selection. As soon as the miners have mapped the area and gathered data on mineral resources, the project may proceed to the design and planning stage. Typically, this involves a company looking at various plans and deciding which one is the greatest fit for their needs.

It is possible for commitments of tens of millions of dollars or more to be made for ongoing exploration and development on the basis of a pre-feasibility study, prior to decision to mine. For example, where ore reserves cannot be proven by surface drilling, underground development may be required for exploration at an early stage of the project.
