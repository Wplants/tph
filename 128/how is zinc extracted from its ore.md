## Reduction of Metals (Extraction from Ore) - A-Level Chemistry
There are 3 main methods of extracting metals from their ore. They are reduction of the ore with carbon, reduction of the molten ore by electrolysis, and reduction of the ore with a more reactive metal. Extraction using carbon. Metals such as zinc, iron and copper are present in ores as their oxides. Each of these oxides is heated with carbon

## Why zinc cannot be extracted by hydrometallurgy?
Score: 4.7/5 (11 votes) . In hydrometallurgy, zinc and iron can be used to displace copper from their solution. But to displace zinc, more reactive metals i.e., metals having lower reduction potentials than zinc such as Mg, Ca, K, etc. As a result, these metals cannot be used in hydrometallurgy to extract zinc.

How zinc is extracted? Zinc is extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by electrowinning, which is a specialized form of electrolysis. The process works by passing an electric current through the solution in a series of cells. This causes the zinc to deposit on the cathodes (aluminium sheets) and oxygen to form at the anodes.

The most commonly available ore used for zinc extraction of zinc is called zinc blende (ZnS) for concentration of ore "Froth flotation" process is used, to remove gangue from sulphide ores. Now extract Metal from concentrated ore Roasting is used, in which sulphur content is reduced and Z n O is formed.
