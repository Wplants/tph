## What is Bentonite? - Industrial Minerals Association - North America
Extracted bentonite is distinctly solid, even with a moisture content of approximately 30%. The material is initially crushed and, if necessary, activated with the addition of soda ash (Na2CO3). Bentonite is subsequently dried (air and/or forced drying) to reach a moisture content of approximately 15%.

## Bentonite Properties are Unique
Soda ash dissolved in water - before adding bentonite - will improve the bentonite properties by adjusting the pH and the ''hardness'' of the water to the ideal range for hydrating the bentonite. Mix approximately 60 grams of soda ash per 100 liters of water (or 1/2 pound per 100 gallons).

## Containing, Disposing of Drilling Mud and Drilling Cuttings
June 1, 2015. Drilling mud — a mixture of water and bentonite clay (usually) we use to advance a borehole into the subsurface. When planning a project, drillers normally have some idea about the type of mud and additives they will use, and it usually includes bentonite, soda ash and water. There are many additives for so many different

SODA ASH should be added slowly through a hopper or chemical barrel. When using a barrel, mix SODA ASH into a full barrel of freshwater and provide adequate agitation. Add SODA ASH until pH of 8.5-9.5 is obtained. Suggested ratio is 0.33 to 0.5 lb per 100 gallons (0.25 kg to 0.5 kg per 380 liters) water. PACKAGING

The material is initially crushed and, if necessary, activated with the addition of soda ash (Na2CO3). Bentonite is subsequently dried (air and/or forced drying) to reach a moisture content of approximately 15%. According to the final application, bentonite is either sieved (granular form) or milled (into powder and superfine powder form).
