## About Vanadium - Bushveld Minerals
Vanadium Market fundamentals. Supply. Vanadium supply is concentrated - by type of production and geography. The most common occurrence of vanadium is in vanadium and titanium bearing magnetite ore bodies from which vanadium is extracted either directly (primary production) or indirectly as a vanadium rich slag during steelmaking or pig-iron production (co-production):

Iron ore was chosen for this study due to the significant amount of this ore mined annually in Australia, as shown in Figure 20.2 over time. Since 2009, the production of iron ore from Australia has risen significantly. The percentage of global production and reserves for the major iron ore-producing countries for 2010 is shown in Figure 20.3

## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

Cast iron is used extensively to make machine parts, engine cylinder blocks, stoves, pipes, steam radiators, and many other products. Gray cast iron, or gray iron, is produced when the iron in the mold is cooled slowly. Part of the carbon separates out in plates in the form of graphite but remains physically mixed in the iron.

The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below. Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).
