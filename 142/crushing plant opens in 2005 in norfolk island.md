## Dealing With Your Ginormous Norfolk Island Pine | Southern Living
Help out your Norfolk Island pine by misting the foliage a couple of times a day or placing it atop a pebble-lined saucer filled with water. Try to keep it away from AC and heating vents. Make sure the soil is well-drained. Let the top surface go dry between thorough waterings, but never let the soil dry completely or you'll have a dead tree.
