The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

## 8 Types of Gold Ore- Properties and Ways to Process
The amount of iron oxide copper gold ore is about 10 million to 4 billion tons. IOCG ore contains copper with a grade of 0.2% to 5% and gold with a content of 0.1 to 1.41 grams per ton. Iron oxide copper gold ore tends to be conical on the edge of granite, or appears as long banded breccia or massive iron oxide ore in faults or shears
