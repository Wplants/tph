## Direct Reduced Iron - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico. DRI offers

## Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes - IspatGuru
Fig 2 Principle of direct reduction process. Gas based process. In the gas based reduction processes, a vertical shaft kiln is used in which iron ore is fed into the top of the kiln and finished sponge iron is drawn off from the bottom after cooling it so as to prevent its re-oxidation.

Tunnel Kiln Coal based DRI plant Tunnel Kiln history dates back to 1807 when Hoganas first used this process to produce iron powder of 99 9% purity When iron ore is mined or processed (in a crusher) lots of fines are generated Quantity of fines generation is a function of the quality of ore i e whether it direct-reduction-of-iron-ore-from
