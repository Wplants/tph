Opencast Mining. Quarry. It is for those minerals which lie close to the surface of the earth. Used where commercially useful minerals are found near the surface. Extracted using Earthmoving machinery. Employed to extract almost all types of minerals and coal. Used for mining minerals at shallow depths. Used for extracting building materials

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

Quarry mining is similar to open-pit mining in many ways. The primary differences are due to the type of material that is mined in a quarry, often categorized as "dimension stone. " Instead of sloped walls like an open-pit sand and gravel mine, a quarry will tend to have vertical or near vertical walls of solid stone.

Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.

## What would make people choose open-pit quarrying instead of tunnel mining?
In the modern world open pit mining is a lot easier due to have excavation machinery, so the modern mining methods are not a good measure. The simple geology of the deposit has a strong effect, drift and slope mines can be profitable for a long time, while shaft mines tend to flood so are often small.
