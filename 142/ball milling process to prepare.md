The use of ball milling to obtain cellulose nanocrystals was also explored by the group of Yu, who extracted CNCs from ball-milled wood via a multi-step process. 40 Douglas-Fir wood chips were firstly hammer-milled to wood flours, which were then treated using a planetary ball mill at 270 rpm. This process was followed by enzymatic hydrolysis

The starting point for ball mill media and liquid charging is generally as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 45% to 50% above the ball charge for total of 58%

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

1. As the name suggests, the ball milling method consists of balls and a mill chamber. Therefore over all a ball mill contains a stainless steel container and many small iron, hardened steel, silicon carbide, or tungsten carbide balls are made to rotate inside a mill (drum). 2. The powder of a material is taken inside the steel container.
