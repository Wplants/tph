Yes, you can. In your driveway, at least. On the highway, repairing potholes is a specialized job that must be done correctly to ensure the highest safety standards.

## Concrete Removal - Quasco
Our resonant technology, combined with a standard milling machine, allows for the fast removal of the concrete slab with little or no post-processing of the rubble. Typically, the rubblized concrete can be immediately re-used as gravel-sized fill. The first step in this process is the rubblization of the existing concrete slab.

## Essay
The word essay derives from the French infinitive essayer, "to try" or "to attempt".In English essay first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", and this is still an alternative meaning. The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne () was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing.

## Can You Use Wood Stain On Concrete? (Find Out Now!) - Upgraded Home
You can use wood stain but concrete stain, as mentioned earlier, is the preferred option if you have the choice. When shopping for concrete stain, know that you can choose from acid-based or water-based products (just as you can with wood stain). An acid-based stain will resist fading and last longer than a water-based one.
