## How Does Construction Affect The Environment - Realonomics
How does construction contribute to climate change? Buildings and their construction together account for 36 percent of global energy use and 39 percent of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions annually according to the United Nations Environment Program. . Globally building operations account for about 28 percent of emissions annually.
