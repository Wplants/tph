## Ettringite precipitation - Mine Closure
Elina Merta, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, P.O. Box 1000, FI-02044 VTT, Finland, elina.merta(at)vtt.fi Introduction Ettringite precipitation (addition of lime and Al(OH)3) can be used to remove sulphate and heavy metals. Ettringite (3CaO·3CaSO4·Al2O3·31H2O) has very low water solubility and therefore the resulting sulphate concentrations are low. Description of the

## Aspects of gypsum precipitation in scaling waters - ScienceDirect
Partially treated gold mine waters, particularly from South Africa's gold mining operations, have high levels of calcium and sulphate ions. Lime, which is used for neutralisation of mine waters, is the source of calcium ions and the sulphate originates from oxidation of pyrite present in gold-bearing ores (Juby and Schutte, 2000).When the solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate (commonly

What is the mining process of gypsum? It is liberated from its natural state most commonly by surface mining. To get the gypsum ore into a state where it can be sold for its many uses, it is crushed to size using DDC-Sizers, Feeder-Breakers, Hammermill Crushers, Jaw Crushers or Roll Crushers and stockpiled to await further processing.

## The kinetics of the precipitation of gypsum, CaSO4·2H2O, over a wide 
Sep 3, 2020Using the data collected, a kinetic model have been suggested that can describe the entire precipitation process of gypsum simultaneously, incorporating nucleation and crystal growth, in a wide concentration range. Our calculations strongly suggest that the inclusion of the CaSO4(aq) ion pair is necessary for the appropriate kinetic description
