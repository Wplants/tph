Burning wood in a biomass plant produces 20 percent more nitrogen, particulate matter and greenhouse gas than electricity from a coal plant. Generating heat with biomass produces twice as much nitrogen as using natural gas for heating. Replacing coal with biomass in the large coal-fired power stations will lead to about 5 percent more emissions

## How much does the biomass gasification cost?
How much does it cost to build a biomass factory? Prices can range from $100 million to $400 million, he says. Is biomass energy expensive? The inefficiency of using forest biomass to generate electricity makes it particularly costly. In fact, biomass power is California's most expensive energy source. Biomass power plants rely heavily on

## How much carbon dioxide (CO2) released from woody biomass power plants?
Each kilowatt hour of electricity generated in a biomass-fired power plant creates a lot of CO2, even more than coal plants. Fortunately, over time, usually many decades, the trees are regrown and they eventually reabsorb the CO2 released from the power plants. This is why many people consider biomass to be a carbon-neutral, renewable source of electricity.
