## Granite - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Granite is the most widespread of igneous rocks, underlying much of the continental crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive rocks form from molten material (magma) that flows and solidifies underground, where magma cools slowly. Eventually, the overlying rocks are removed, exposing the granite.

Pegmatite can also form in fractures that develop on the margins of the batholith. This is how "pegmatite dikes" are formed. Because these dikes and pockets are small in size, the mining operations that exploit them are also small. The mining of pegmatites might be done in an underground operation that follows a dike or exploits a small pocket.
