The SERPENTINE system is a viable technology for the recovery of copper, silver and subsequent recovery of HCN gas by scrubbing

Silver recovery research from x-ray film waste by leaching and precipitation method using NaOH and Na2S aims to determine the optimum conditions in silver recovery. The parameters optimated in this study were the concentration of the precipitants, leaching temperature and the effect of the type of precipitants on the precipitated time.

## Removing Tarnish from Silver - Compound Interest
Silver tarnishes in air to form a black coating of silver sulphide, which has the formula Ag 2 S. The chemical equation for the formation of silver tarnish following reaction with hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) is as follows:. 2 Ag (s) + H 2 S (g) → Ag 2 S (s) + H 2(g). There's speculation that, in the present day, tarnishing of silver actually occurs more quickly due to the increased amounts

## Separate recovery of silver and gold from cyanide solutions
We claim: 1. A process for selective recovery of silver and gold from cyanide solutions containing both metals comprising (1) adding to the solution about 0.1 to 2.2 pound CaO per ton of solution, (2) treating the resulting solution with sodium sulfide in an amount of about 110 to 150 percent of the stoichiometric amount to precipitate the silver as silver sulfide, (3) filtering to remove the
