## Dolomite Usage In Iron and Steel Industry | Aravali Onyx
Applications of Dolomite In the Iron and Steel Industry. Dolomite (CaMgCO3)2 is a naturally occurring dry carbonate mineral having calcium and magnesium carbonate as its primary components. It is also known as dolostone, a mineral that forms the major constituent of sedimentary rocks. It is also a constituent of metamorphic rocks and limestone.

Dolomite as a mineral has very few uses. However, dolostone has an enormous number of uses because it occurs in deposits that are large enough to mine. The most common use for dolostone is in the construction industry. It is crushed and sized for use as a road base material, an aggregate in concrete and asphalt, railroad ballast, rip-rap, or fill.

Regarding the dosage of Dolomite powder: try to look at the acidity of the soil, for example, if the soil is below 4.0, i.e. the soil is acidic, 60 kg of Dolomite powder per hectare is allowed. If the pH is between 4.1 and 5.0 and the soil is moderately acidic, the "dosage" of fertilizer can be reduced to 50 kg per hectare.

If your soil registers with a pH of 5.9 or below, dolomite can raise the pH to make
