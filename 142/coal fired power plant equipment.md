## Wikizero - Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel

Pollution Control. Thermal Power Plants produce electricity by first creating heat, and the U.S.A. still produces most of our energy by burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, or oil) to create this heat. Despite our nation's move towards clean, renewable energy production, coal-fired plants still produce about 30% of our electricity.

## Coal- & coke-fired power plant equipment | Schenck Process
Our gravimetric feeders compensate for the variation in bulk density and feed a fixed weight of coal in response to a boiler fuel demand. Gravimetric feeders have become the industry standard in coal fired power plants, reducing fuel costs through improved boiler efficiency, shortening downtimes, and reducing NOx emissions.

## A Coal-Fired Thermoelectric Power Plant Completed - USGS
It is a 3,520,000-kilowatt coal-fired facility that provides electricity for Georgia. As this diagram shows, the plant operates on the same principles as other fossil-fueled electric generating plants—it burns coal to produce heat that turns water into steam, which then turns turbines in a generator.
