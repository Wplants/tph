## acid rain - Effects on human-made structures | Britannica
Acid deposition also affects human-made structures. The most notable effects occur on marble and limestone, which are common building materials found in many historic structures, monuments, and gravestones. Sulfur dioxide, an acid rain precursor, can react directly with limestone in the presence of water to form gypsum, which eventually flakes off or is dissolved by water. In addition, acid

Jun 1, 2022Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation (snow, hail, even mist) that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions and a low pH. Acid rain, also called acid precipitation or acid deposition, is classified as acidic based on it having a pH of 5 or less. As a comparison, water, especially drinking water

Normal rain has a pH value of 5.6, acid rain refers to solutions with a pH below 5.6 because carbon dioxide dissolves into the rain forming a weak carbonic acid. Throughout this experiment, the acids will have a pH of 2. This is due to the reason that building material in the real world is exposed to acid rain constantly, through many years.

Abstract Acid Rain has a lot of effects on living organisms and on the environment. This experiment has two purposes. One is to determine the acidity of rainwater in certain areas in the Philippines. Another purpose is to determine which type of area-urban or rural- is more subjected to acid rain.The experiment was done by first collecting rainwater from selected rural and urban areas.

Strand 3: Acid Rain Experiment. Acid rain is a major environmental issue throughout Connecticut and much of the United States. Acid rain occurs when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide from coal burning power plants and nitrogen oxides from car exhaust, combine with the moisture in the atmosphere to create sulfuric and nitric acids.

## Acid rain
Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH ). Most water, including drinking water, has a neutral pH that exists between 6.5 and 8.5, but acid rain has a pH level lower than this and ranges from 4-5 on average.

See the effects of acid rain. Acid rain is created when the rain water becomes too acidic. This can be caused by the burning of fossil fuels, which contain sulfur. When the sulfur is released into the air as sulfur dioxide, it can mix with the water in clouds and form an acid. For our experiment, we will simulate this with vinegar, a different

## How does acid precipitation affect marble and limestone buildings 
When sulfurous, sulfuric, and nitric acids in polluted air and rain react with the calcite in marble and limestone, the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues, we see roughened surfaces, removal of material, and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive.

## Acid Rain & Experiment - WCS
Getting ready for the experiment. We made the fake acid rain by mixing sulfuric acid to water until the pH level reached level 3. Which was 1L of water with about 1.5 mL of Sulfuric Acid. The plants which were watered with regular water will be the control group, and the plants watered with the acid water will be the experimental group.

##  Lab Acid Rain.edu
Describe how this models the production of acid rain. 5. Precipitation with a pH less than 5.6 is defined as acid deposition. How does the pH of your solutions (A, B, and C) compare to this value. 6. If liquids similar to the solutions in the plastic baggies moistened a marble (CaCO 3) statue or steel girders, what effect might it have? 7.
