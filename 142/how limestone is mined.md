## How Limestone is Formed
Limestone has a lot of different industrial uses and can be mined and processed for those reasons as a raw material. It can also be used in agriculture, the environment and many other areas. As little as 10 years ago, crushed limestone was about 68% of all crushed rock produced within the country.

Mining limestone begins with its extraction from viable deposits in mines and quarries, like the one present in the Lake Belt Region of western Miami-Dade County. There is no naturally formed rock anywhere in the world that demonstrates the versatility of limestone. Crushing or screening the rock only bolsters the multiplicity of applications.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
