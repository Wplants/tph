## How To Identify Gold Ore - Realonomics
What does gold look like in ore? The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow but the greater the silver content the whiter its color is. Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens. The ore is often brown iron-stained rock or massive white Quartz and usually contains only minute traces of gold.

## How to Effectively Identify the Gold Ore? | Fote Machinery
Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

Canada Gold Mining Areas - Clickable Resource Map. Canada has fantastic opportunities for gold prospecting! Many parts of the country are vast and relatively unexplored, meaning there is a very high likelihood that there are undiscovered gold deposits that are yet to be found. Some of the largest gold mines in the world are located in Canada.

Perform a simple test of the material in the pan to assess whether it is real gold. Raw gold appears brassy yellow and bright. If you think it is gold, place your hand between it and the sun to create shade over the gold. If it still appears bright in the pan, chances are that it is real gold. Fool's gold does not appear as bright when shaded.

Step 2: Check the hardness Test the material's hardness with a steel file. Gold is soft, and bends easily, so if the material bounces back from the file; it is made of some other material.
