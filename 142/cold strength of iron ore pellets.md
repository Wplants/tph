## Cold Bonding of Iron Ore Concentrate Pellets | Semantic Scholar
Iron ore concentrate pellets are traditionally hardened at high temperatures in horizontal grates and grate-kiln furnaces. However, heat induration requires tremendous quantities of energy to produce high-quality pellets, and is consequently expensive. Cold bonding is a low-temperature alternative to heat induration. Pellets can be cold bonded using lime, cement, sponge iron powder, and

## Compression Testing of Green and Dry Iron Ore Pellets
The load diameters, fracture diameters, and compressive strengths for the 2.01 lb/min and 3.67 lb/min rates are not significantly different at the 95% level, but these parameters are significantly different for the 3.67 lb/min and 4.20 lb/min rates. Some of the increase in fracture load is caused by the immediate failure of the weaker pellets.
