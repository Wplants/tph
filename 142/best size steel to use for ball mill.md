February 7, 2020. Ball nose end mills, also known as full radius end mills or ball mills, are cutting tools where the nose radius is equal to half of the diameter of the tool. This creates a constant single radius (or ball) at the tool end with no straight edge (sharp corners) in the profile. They are used for a host of milling operations from

The larger the diameter, the slower the rotation. If the peripheral speed of the mill is too great, it begins to act like a centrifuge and the balls do not fall back, but stay on the perimeter of the mill. The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed", and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical
