## How do you find gold in nature?ntal
When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides.  Since glass has a hardness of around 5.5 it will only be scratched by harder minerals like pyrite and quartz. If the glass doesn't scratch then that's a great sign

## Gold: The precious metal Gold information and pictures - minerals
The purity of Gold depends on the percentage of alloyed metal, and this number is measured in karats. The karat measurement determines the percentage of gold to other metals on a scale of 1 to 24, with 24 karats being pure gold. Common karat weights are 22 kt (91.67% gold), 18 kt (75% gold), 14 kt (58.33% gold), and 10 kt (41.67% gold). Pure 24

Gold from Oriental mine, Sierra Co., California, United States - RW47811. Gold has been the most prized metal that is a chemical element with the symbol Au. It is opaque, has a highly attractive metallic golden yellow color, is extremely malleable, and is usually found in a relatively pure form. It is remarkably inert, so it resists tarnish.

Fool's Gold can be one of three minerals. The most common mineral mistaken for gold is pyrite. Chalcopyrite may also appear gold-like, and weathered mica can mimic gold as well.
