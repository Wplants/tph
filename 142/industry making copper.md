## Why we need a holistic approach for responsible copper production
Downstream or midstream users from other sectors which rely on copper, such as the automotive and tech sectors, can join and become official partners. Ford, Google, Intel or Wieland are recent examples of companies in the copper value chain who have become Copper Mark Partners, making a commitment to the Copper Mark's vision and objectives.

Cons. Discoloration. The primary disadvantage of copper jewelry is the possibility of your skin turning green. Copper can readily oxidize in air and moisture and form copper oxide. This substance causes skin discoloration. Although it can be a nuisance to wearers, skin discoloration from jewelry is usually not harmful.
