## 5 Ways to Control the Ball Mill Noise - JXSC Machine
Introduction. The ball mill is indispensable grinding equipment in the ore beneficiation process.How to control the ball mill noise? Ball mill is mainly used for grinding materials in the industrial production process. Due to the large volume and heavy tonnage, the noise ( strong vibration and noise ) generated is usually above 95dB(A), which is serious affects the physical and mental health
