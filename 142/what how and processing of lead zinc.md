The zinc content dissolves whereas iron precipitates and lead and silver remain undissolved. However, the dissolved solution contains some impurities which need to be eliminated in order to obtain a high-purity zinc product at the end of the production process. Purification is mainly done by adding zinc dust to the solution.

Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

## Lead-zinc Ore Processing Plant - Hongxing Machinery
The Processing is Novel and the Operating Cost is Lower: The regrinding process of lead-zinc mixed concentrate eliminates the need to finely grind all the raw ore, which saves the cost of grinding. At the same time, the re-grinding of the concentrate makes the lead-zinc concentrate to improve the monomer dissociation, and it has a good de-drug effect, which creates favorable conditions for the
