## coal - Students | Britannica Kids | Homework Help
Over the past 20 years, surface mining has become the most common method of extracting coal in the United States. Where feasible, surface mining is about three times more productive than underground mining. This is because the coal deposits lie closer to the surface and can be more easily removed by large excavating equipment.

Safe, green and efficient mining is an important way to optimize the development of coal resources, maximize economic and social benefits and minimize ecological effect (Fan et al. 2017; Li 2021; Yuan 2016).However, in recent years, with the gradual deep mining of coal mines, coal and rock dynamic disasters have become more and more serious (Du et al. 2020; Li et al. 2016, 2021; Si et al. 2021).

Advances in technology have significantly reduced the long-term health risks associated with underground coal mining. While the potential risks include exposure to hazardous substances and noise, the reduction of respirable dust in the workplace has been emphasized here because of the greater probability of exposure and the well-documented consequences.

Coal Mining Methods. The method used to mine coal depends on the terrain and the depth of the coal. Before the early 1970s most coal was taken from underground mines. Since then, coal production has shifted to surface mines. (See Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2.) Underground mining is required when the coal lies more than 200 feet (61 m) below ground.

## mining - Students | Britannica Kids | Homework Help
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. There is a wide range of principal methods that can be used to mine such deposits. Room-and-pillar underground mining methods for many metal and nonmetal deposits differ from those of coal and other softer mineral deposits; these differences are primarily ones of equipment used, method of breaking up the ore, and ways of removing the ore from the mine.

There are six principal methods of underground mining: Longwall mining accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of 1,000 feet (300 m) or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls on to a pan line

## Bord and pillar mining - Coal and coal mining - Te Ara
Bord and pillar mining. This diagram shows the traditional method of bord and pillar mining. Miners extracted coal along roadways or bords, with the coal between the bords acting as pillars holding up the roof. The outer pillars were then mined, leaving the roof to collapse in a controlled way as the miners retreated towards the exit.

The various methods of mining a coal seam can be classified under two headings, surface mining and underground mining. Surface and underground coal mining are broad activities that incorporate numerous variations in equipment and methods, and the choice of which method to use in extracting a coal seam depends on many technological, economic, and social factors.

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal
