## Iron ore filtration process improvement through pH modification
Mar 6, 2021The present study evaluates the iron ore slurry transferred from a beneficiation plant to the filtration unit in a long range pipeline. Iron ore slurry is received in buffer tanks and distributed to vacuum filter discs. Vacuum disk filters remove water from slurry to produce a filter cake with outcome moisture content ranging 10% to 11%.
