## Copper Scrap - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Recovery of old copper scrap from waste streams depends on the type of waste, the location of the waste stream, and the price of copper (Vexler et al., 2004). High-grade streams such as IEW are profitable to process and recycle, so most of the copper from this waste is recovered (Glöser et al., 2013). Although few statistics are kept, the same

Northern NJ, USA. May 10, 2008. #6. All above is correct- and home-brewers typically use "Refrigeration" grade copper- which just means that it is softer, and thus easy to work with when bending it into whatever position is needed. And- not to state the obvious- but it needs to be properly cleaned and sanitized prior to touching any cooled wort.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
