## Ten Richest Mining Districts in the World - by Stan Sudol
It has sufficient reserves to guarantee production for about 400 years at current levels. The deposit was discovered in 1967 by a helicopter mineral survey crew on an emergency refueling stop. Brazil is the second largest global producer after China. Australia holds the sixth spot with the rich bauxite deposits at Weipa, Queensland.

## Where Can Valuable Mineral Deposits Such As Gold Form
Deposits of minerals form when a medium that contains and transports mineral-making ore releases and deposits the ore. Magma is one such medium that transports ores. When magma or lava cools the magma and ore carried within it crystallize to form tiny minerals in the newly-created igneous rock.

## A review of silver-rich mineral deposits and their metallogeny
Pre-mineral volcanic rocks and their detritus may occur deep within the basin and gold is typically absent. Lithogene silver-rich deposits are epigenetic products of varying combinations of compaction, dewatering, meteoric water recharge, and metamorphism of rift basin-related clastic sedimentary and interbedded volcanic rocks.

The energy released along plate boundaries results in volcanic and hydrothermal activity that creates the right conditions for mineral concentration. Plate boundaries are also a way for deep-seated rocks from the mantle to find a way to the near-surface. These rocks become the source of many of our largest mineral deposits.

Aug 18, 2022A mineral deposit that is sufficiently rich to be worked at a profit is called an ore deposit, and in an ore deposit the assemblage of ore minerals plus gangue is called the ore. All ore deposits are mineral deposits, but the reverse is not true. Ore deposit is an economic term, while mineral deposit is a geologic term.

Summary: Banded-iron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary mineral deposits consisting of alternating beds of iron-rich minerals (mostly hematite) and silica-rich layers (chert or quartz) formed about 3.0 to 1.8 billion years ago.Theory suggests BIFs are associated with the capture of oxygen released by photosynthetic processes by iron dissolved in ancient ocean water.
