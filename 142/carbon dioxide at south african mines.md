## The Carbon Brief Profile: South Africa - Carbon Brief
Carbon Brief's country profile series. South Africa is the world's 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Its CO2 emissions are principally due to a heavy reliance on coal. However, a recently released draft electricity plan proposes a significant shift away from the fuel, towards gas and renewables.

The aim is to produce an approximate 98% concentration of carbon dioxide. Currently, South Africa has the largest carbon dioxide capture plants in the world, about 25 million tonnes per year particularly from the synthetic fuel industry. Such gas provides 'lowhanging fruit' that will lower the cost of utilisation and storage.

## Carbon Dioxide At South African Mines
the carbon and oxygen form carbon dioxide, and the lead is left behind as a metal. this is the same process that is used in iron extraction in the blast furnace, that we discussed above. coke, which is mainly carbon, removes the oxygens from the iron(iii) oxide to form carbon dioxide .

## Conflict implications of coal mining and environmental  - ACCORD
Even though carbon dioxide is known to be the largest contributor to global warming yet, methane is 21 times more potent, since its greenhouse effect will become greater than that of carbon dioxide (Lloyd 2002:2).
