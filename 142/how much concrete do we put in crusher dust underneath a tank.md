With fine, powder-like qualities, crusher dust compacts to create a strong, sturdy surface. Made up of a mix of small crushed rocks and fine aggregates, this versatile material can be used as a base layer under concrete slabs, water tanks, piping, and anything that will be paved or covered over.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs 
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

The above information is just a side-note. To eliminate the issue of erosion, sand can be contained in timber or any other appropriate edging/frame (either rock, concrete). The sand base must extend at least 300 mm (12 inches) from the side walls of your tank and must be 70 - 75 mm (3-4 inch) deep. Same rule applies for crusher dust.
