The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity.  Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year

##  SOUTH AFRICAN COAL SECTOR REPORT - Energy
Coal in the ground is classified as a coal resource and only once an applicable study has been completed to determine economic viability and based on a mine plan, can the coal be classified as a coal reserve. South Africa's coal resources are contained in the Ecca deposits, a stratum of the Karoo Supergroup.
