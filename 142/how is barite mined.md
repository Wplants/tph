Barite is the principal ore of barium. Barium has very high number of applications. It is known to have more than 2000 industrial uses. However, the majority of barite mined is not used to extract barium. It is valuable in its native form because of high density. It is mostly used by oil & gas industry as an ingredient of drilling mud.

## Barite Gem Guide and Properties Chart | Gemstones
Barite is mostly mined as an ore for barium. It can form as crystals or as an aggregate. The mineral is most often white or colorless but can form in array of colors. Crystals are transparent to opaque with prismatic, tabular, bladed, or acicular habits. Aggregates can be massive, granular, concretionary, and fibrous.

Some smaller mines utilize barite from veins, which formed when barium sulphate precipitated from hot subterranean waters. Where is barite commonly found? Major deposits in the United States have been found in Georgia, Missouri, Nevada and Tennessee. In Canada, the mineral has been mined in the Yukon Territory, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

Barite was first mined in Virginia in Prince William County near the town of Catlett. Here, mining occurred on and off between 1845 and 1903. The barite deposits were identified within a fracture zone of limestone breccia and sandy shales with barite-filled fractures (Watson, 1907).

## Barite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and

Barite or Baryte (Ba S O> 4) is a natural mineral consisting of barium and sulfate. The mineral is abundant around the world but is rarely in economically high concentrations. Scotland has two known economical sources; Foss Mine and Duntanlich mine. The mineral characteristics of Barite are: Hardness 3-3.5 (Mohs) Pure Barite Density 4.48t/m3

The barite crystals have a brilliant, glassy luster and contrast nicely with the matrix of white, crystalline quartz. Is barite mined? Most baryte is mined from layers of sedimentary rock which formed when baryte precipitated onto the bottom of the ocean floor. Some smaller mines utilize barite from veins, which formed when barium sulphate

## How is barite mined?hcharge
How is barium mined and processed? By far, the principal use for barite is as a "weighting agent" in oil and natural gas drilling. In this process, barite is crushed and mixed with water and other materials. It is then pumped into the drill hole. The weight of this mixture counteracts the force of the oil and gas when it is released from

Because barium is so dense it is commonly used in some alloys, for example in spark plugs and ball bearings. As of 2013, China, India and Morocco were the world's largest producers of barium. In the U.S, barite is mined primarily in Nevada and
