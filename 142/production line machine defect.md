As in visual inspections, camera-based inspections have to ensure a defect rate of <=1 ppm for critical defects. The automated systems can tolerate a far higher input defect rate than visual inspections. However, there is a limit for process validation purposes and the production line has to be stopped if the input defect rate gets too high.
