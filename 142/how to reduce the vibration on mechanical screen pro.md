## How to reduce noise and vibration??? - Mechanical Acoustics/Vibration 
First you need to find out if the noise is caused by mechanical defects including support structure cracks, etc. If it is, correcting the defects may considerably reduce the noise. If the vibration source is not from a machine defect, then you can start addressing the use of sound reduction treatments once you know the frequencies involved.
