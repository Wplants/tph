Presently, the most effective and often followed route taken to utilize such deposits is the provision of beneficiation plants for upgrading iron ore and pelletizing plants for agglomerating. Kobe Steel has much experience

Indian mining industries primarily depend upon high-grade fines mainly because of two factors, one is lack of beneficiation infrastructure and high cost of low-grade fines, the second one is lack of proper tail disposal system. Due to lapses in our policies, miners get better premium by selling high-grade fines over low-grade fines. This restricts the flow of low-grade fines into the market

##  Key Points Downstream Beneficiation Case Study: Oman - Columbia University
The country has a growing iron ore-pelletizing sector, with Brazilian mining and metals giant Vale having commissioned its $1.35bn iron ore beneficiation plant in early 2012 with the objective of servicing ore imported from Brazil. This plant consists of two processing lines, each having a capacity
