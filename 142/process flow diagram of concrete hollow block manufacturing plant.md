A typical concrete block weighs 38-43 lb (17.2-19.5 kg). In general, the concrete mixture used for blocks has a higher percentage of sand and a lower percentage of gravel and water than the concrete mixtures used for general construction purposes. This produces a very dry, stiff mixture that holds its shape when it is removed from the block mold.

## Concrete block manufacturing process - BESS
Below you can read about them. 1. Manual concrete block manufacturing process: The manual method is the simplest and cheapest way. All you need is molds. The concrete is mixed manually and then poured into the concrete block molds. Usually, there is no vibration and high pressure in the manual method so the quality of the concrete blocks is low.
