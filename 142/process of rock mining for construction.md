## Quick Guide to Hard Rock Mining | An Underground Miner
Hard rock mining is a process that includes various techniques of excavating minerals from hard rock - especially those that contain metals such as silver, gold, iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel. This process also involves the same techniques while excavating large ore bodies containing gems such as rubies and diamonds.

Before the commencement of the rock blasting work, the supervisor mining engineer will be notified of the areas where rock will be blasted. Accordingly, the engineer will inspect the area for approval or confirmation. Drilling will commence only after the completion of rock survey in order to determine the locations and drilling depths required.

## How Granite is Extracted from the Earth - Engineering Specialists, Inc.
Extracting the Rock. Granite is usually formed into slabs or large deposits. There are different methods used by mining companies to cut and extract the deposits from the ground which are called quarries. When the granite is extracted, the mining team uses large equipment such as extractors and cranes to slowly dig around the deposits.

Strip Mining involves stripping the surface away from the mineral that's being excavated (usually coal). Soil, rock, and vegetation over the mineral seam is removed with huge machines, including bucket-wheel excavators. Open-Pit Mining is a technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open-air pit.

## Study on characteristics of pressure relief by roof cutting under 
In view of the problems of the CGER technique, the cutting cantilever beam theory was proposed by Manchao He in 2008, and a new nonpillar-mining approach—noncoal pillar mining with automatically formed gob-side entry (NMAFGE)—was developed based on this theory (He et al. 2021, 2015; Tao et al. 2018).The surrounding rock structure of roadway under NMAFGE approach is shown in Fig. 2b.

Radiation Facts. Regardless of how uranium is removed from rock, the extraction process creates radioactive wastes. If not managed properly, mining waste and mill tailings can contaminate the environment. Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that has been mined and used for its chemical properties for more than a thousand years.

Rock crushers are machines designed to break large rock parts into smaller pieces or get rock dust and gravel. The truth is that rock crushing appliances are vital for most modern commercial mining works. It is because a mining industry can leverage the ability of rock crushers to process rocks with ore before the mineral is derived later.

## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations, which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined. Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological
