This method considers the limitation of the surface confining pressure on the rock crushing process but does not consider the infiltration of water and the diffusion of internal confining pressure during the cutting process. Therefore, there is a large gap between the above methods and the deep-sea mineral crushing process.

## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Crushing is accomplished by compression of the ore against a rigid surface or by impact against a surface in a rigidly constrained motion path. Crushing is usually a dry process and carried out on ROM ore in succession of two or three stages, namely, by (1) primary, (2) secondary, and (3) tertiary crushers. 13.3.1.1 Primary Crusher
