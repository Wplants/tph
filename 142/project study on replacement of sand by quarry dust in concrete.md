This study present the potential of quarry dust as partial replacement in concrete. Quarry dust is used as partial sand replacement for sand namely as QDC5, QDC10, QDC15, QDC20 and QDC25 for 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% replacement respectively following normal concrete as OPC. All specimens were tested for compressive strength at the age of 7, 14

Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M 20.

investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.

## An Experimental Study on Usage of Quarry Rock Dust as Partial 
In this paper, we have investigated the study of quarry rock dust as partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. Mix design has been developed for M20 grade using IS design for conventional concrete and replaced mix. Specimens on cubes, cylinders and beams were prepared for both conventional and 20%, 40%, 60% replacement with quarry dust.
