## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Once the recycled concrete has been sourced, it can be processed. This starts with crushing. RCA is first crushed using industrial equipment. This step in the process breaks up the original structure, reducing it from larger slabs into a granulated material. After the concrete is crushed, it's then run through another impactor.

## Eco-Friendly Alternatives To Traditional Concrete
Posted on July 18, 2019. Concrete is a mixture of cement, gravel, sand, water and a range of aggregates. With about 10 billion tons of concrete produced every year, it is the most consumed substance in the world, second only to water.. It is also the world's most widely used material for construction - from bridges to large buildings, concrete forms the very foundation of our infrastructure.

There are 97 25kg bags of concrete in a cubic meter. There are 45 bags of concrete per cubic yard. A cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet (46,656 cubic inches) or 45 80-pound bags. A bag of ready mix concrete weighing 80 pounds will create approximately 0.60 cubic feet of concrete. As a result, it takes 45 bags to fill one cubic yard.
