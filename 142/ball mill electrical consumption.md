## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.
