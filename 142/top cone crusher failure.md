Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

## Analysis of the Wear Failure of Cone Crusher Liner at Copper Mine
From the first picture "Wear Morphology After Cone Crusher Liners Failure x100", The cone-crushing motorized lining plate performs an eccentric rotation motion. When it is deflected to the fixed lining plate, it will give a huge impact load to the broken ore, causing the lining plate to be squeezed and plastically deformed.
