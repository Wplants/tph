## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

## Operation Factors of Iron Ore Beneficiation Magnetic Separator
In actual production, the operation of the magnetic separator has a very obvious impact on the separation index of iron ore. The main operating factors are the thickness of the feed layer of the magnetic separator, the rotational speed of the magnetic separator cylinder, the feeding speed, and the water inlet control. 1.
