## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

## What is open pit coal mining?rsandscience
Why is open pit mining cheaper? Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc.

Apr 11, 2022O pen Pit Mining also called open-cut or open-cast mining, is surface mining technique of extracting minerals or rock from beneath the earth, often dug in an open area. This type of mining is one of the numerous varieties of surface mining that has been used since ancient times for different types of minerals. It involves large amounts of rock and is therefore expensive to produce.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit.
