##  CHAPTER 5 Markets and Projected Demand for Federal Coal
the demand for coal. High levels in the elec-trical growth rate, high steel production, and extensive conversion of industrial and elec-tric utility boilers to coal from oil and gas will all mean an increase in coal demand. High levels of coal-based synthetic fuels develop-ment and high overseas demand for coal will also increase coal markets.

Summary - Types Of Coal (& Uses) Coal comes in various types, from the softer brown coal with higher moisture content and lower amounts of carbon and energy content, to various stages of harder black coal with less moisture and more carbon and energy content. We mainly use coal in society for energy generation for electricity, but also for key products and processes like steel production.

The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four
