## Is coal a raw material for cement? - Origin of coal
Why coal is used in cement plant? Coal is the main fuel for manufacture of cement in India, due to high cost and inadequate availability of oil and gas. The consumption of coal in dry process system ranges from 20-25% of clinker production. That means 0.20-0.25 t of coal is consumed to produce one tonne of clinker.
