## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Aggregate required for 1  - Happho
Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags = 300 kgs. 2.Fine Aggregate = 115/0.167 = 689 kg.

If we need to add 1m 3 sand in the concrete mix ratio, we take 1.3 m 3 (30% more). The reason for that is the moisture content present in the sand makes it a little bulkier.
