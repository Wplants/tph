Cement Mortar. Cement Mortar is one of the most common and cheapest binding materials used in construction industry.Cement mortar is basically a mixture of cement, sand & water.It is used in various aspects of civil engineering works such as masonry, brickwork, plastering, flooring etc.There are two types, dry mortar and wet mortar.

## What is Cement? - Definition from Corrosionpedia
Cement is a dry powdery substance made by calcining lime and clay, mixed with water to form mortar or mixed with sand, gravel and water to make concrete. It is a binder material. Once hardened, cement delivers sufficient strength to erect large industrial structures. Cement is corrosive to metals and therefore any metals in contact with cement

Hydrophobic Cement. This type of cement includes admixtures, which reduces the wetting capability of cement grains. The typical hydrophobic admixtures are acidol naphthene soap, oxidized petrolatum, etc. when hydrophobic cement is used, the fire pores in concrete are uniformly dispersed, and so the frost resistance, as well as the water-resistance of this concrete, are substantially increased.

Hydrophobic cement is a special type of water-repellent cement because of formation of a film around each particle of cement. It is manufactured by intergrinding Portland cement with 0.1 to 0.4 % of oleic acid.
