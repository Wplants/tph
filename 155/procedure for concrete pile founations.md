pile foundations. 1.1 Pile foundations Pile foundations are the part of a structure used to carry and transfer the load of the structure to the bearing ground located at some depth below ground surface. The main components of the foundation are the pile cap and the piles. Piles are long and slender members which transfer the load to deeper soil or

Introduction of Pile Cap: The pile cap is a type of thick concrete mat-like structure which rests on the pile (timber or concrete) which gives a stable foundation to the whole system.; This concrete pile cap transfers the entire load of the superstructure to the into the piles, which gives you a stable bearing capacity.; The similar structure of the pile cap is a raft foundation, where there

The second method was developed by a British piling company that has introduced a system which uses precast sections for the core of the pile. A hole is bored in the ground to the required depth and lined with a steel casting made up in convenient lengths. The precast sections are then threaded over a central steel tube to form the pile core.

## Notional Piles for Generalized Foundation Modeling Based on the Novak 
Mar 1, 2021Date: 3/1/2021. Abstract: The "Notional Pile" formulation is developed for modeling a group of piles in a foundation. It is a new procedure for foundation modeling for dynamic analysis in conformance with ACI 351.3R. It is an augmentation of the well-known Novak procedure. Foundation stiffness is represented as a set of notional pile elements.

## Pile Foundation Construction Process - Step by Step - TheengineeringEdu
The construction process of the piles depends on several very important aspects such as, a well-implemented soil study, the use of the appropriate equipment to drill the ground, a suitable design of the foundation design, obtaining the appropriate steel for the foundation and finally that the concrete has the necessary resistance, we will see all these aspects in more detail in this article.

## ACI 318 Concrete Pile Design | SkyCiv Engineering
Aug 15, 2022The contribution of concrete to the shear capacity is computed as shown on equation (4) which is defined on Section 22.5.5.1 of ACI 318-14. V c = 0.17 × λ × f c ′ × b × d (4) λ = Concrete modification factor = 1 (Normal weight concrete, Table 19.2.4.2) fc' = Strength of concrete. b = Pile width or diameter.
