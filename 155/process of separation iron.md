It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs. The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process, that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag. What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.
