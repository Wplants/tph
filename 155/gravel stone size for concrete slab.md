## Gravel Calculator | How much gravel do you need?
Apr 28, 2022Step one is establishing the volume of gravel needed. It is equal to the volume of an excavation, and you can do it in the following way: Determine the length and width of a cuboidal excavation. In our example the excavation length is l = 6 yd and the width is b = 3 yd.; Calculate the area of the excavation, multiplying the length and width together. In our case, A = 6  3 = 18 yd².

Jun 18, 2022A typical concrete mix contains 60 to 80 percent sand and gravel, also known as an "aggregate." This aggregate compound is more than filler. It plays an important part in the concrete's composition. The amount of sand and gravel in a bag of concrete determines the mixture's strength and texture.

Crusher-run gravel compacts well but does not drain very fast -- at least not as fast as 3/4-inch crushed stone (no fines). Talk to a soils engineer if you are worried -- but in my experience, either crusher-run gravel (compacted) or 3/4-inch crushed stone can be used under footings. So can rigid foam. An engineer may disagree.
