## Mining Industry - Introduction to Mining Financial Concepts
Feb 27, 2022The mining industry is involved in the extraction of precious minerals and other geological materials. The extracted materials are transformed into a mineralized form that serves an economic benefit to the prospector or miner. Typical activities in the mining industry include metals production, metals investing, and metals trading.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3% of its gross domestic product, due to the influence of its vast oil resources. The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped, leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically, such as salt or iron ore.Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria, which grants titles

## How Canada's Mining Sector Impacts the Economy - Visual Capitalist
According to a study commissioned by the Ontario Mining Association, the economic impact of one new gold mine in Ontario can create ~4,000 jobs during construction and production, and can contribute $38 to $43 million to the economy once operating. Further, more than 16,500 Indigenous peoples were employed in the mineral sector in 2016

Feb 26, 2021High industry fragmentation. The gold industry remains one of the most fragmented industries in the mining sector (Exhibit 3). The top five gold producers contribute less than 20 percent of the world's total gold. In contrast, for most other metals, the top five producers make up between one-third and two-thirds of global production.

## Injury rate and risk factors among small-scale gold miners in Ghana 
To determine the potential risk factors for injury, estimate the annual injury rate and examine the safety perceptions, and use of personal protective equipment among small-scale gold miners in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 494 small-scale gold miners from four major mining districts in Ghana. A household-based approach was used to obtain a representative sample of miners.
