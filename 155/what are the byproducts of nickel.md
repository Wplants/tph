## Adsorption of Cadmium and Nickel by Modified Agricultural Byproducts
The optimum adsorption percentage of cadmium (> 99.0%) and nickel (> 98.0%) was achieved when using 5 g/L as adsorbent dose and 50 mg/L as initial concentration. The adsorption competition between cadmium and nickel was investigated. The result shows that cadmium affected nickel adsorption more than nickel did on cadmium.

As the magma cooled, nickel and copper minerals crystallized into a solid ore body. The bottom of the ore body sits roughly 3,000 feet deep and measures to be roughly 6 acres in size. We have two ore types; massive and semi-massive sulfide. Massive sulfide is about 6.5 percent nickel and 3.8 percent copper.

The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised
