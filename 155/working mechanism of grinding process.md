It can be seen that the process is similar to conventional grinding. In that, an abrasive grinding wheel is used and the work is fed against the rotating wheel. In fact, 10% of the work metal is removed by abrasive cutting, and 90% by electrolytic action. The grinding wheels used are of conventional shape and structure.

The drill bits are also called as Multi-point cutting tools which can have their rapid impact on the Material Removal Rate (MRR) i.e. a single-point cutting tool (like the one used in a lathe machine) can remove the material slowly whereas, a multi-point cutting tool
