Mining Iowa's Treasures. Coal was mined in southeastern Iowa as early as the 1840s by early settlers.  Within 20 years, rail tracks crossed the entire state and Iowa mined more coal than any other state west of the Mississippi River. Between 1860 and 1967, over 400 mines were registered in Marion County alone. Links to info about Coal

The study tracked areas in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Mountaintop mining is categorized as surface mining, unlike traditional mining strategies. Vegetation is clearing from the top of a mountain, then explosives are used to destroy the surface of the hill or mountain. This process exposes any coal underneath.

By 1873, the mine was the largest in Iowa, producing roughly 400 tons of coal per day. Much of the coal from the Beacon area was shipped on the Keokuk and Des Moines Railroad, to be sold on the market there for steamboats and other commercial applications. "Beacon received a railroad before Oskaloosa," Jacobs explained.

As with many other small towns in Iowa, Perry owes part of its origins to coal mining. By 1895, Iowa had 342 coal mines that employed over 6000 miners. Thirty years later, at the height of coal mining, twice as many people were employed as miners, with coal production steadily declining in the years after.
