## Dealing With Uncertainty And Risk In Rock Engineering Design | SRK 
Uncertainties include measurement errors, insufficient data, sampling bias, stress state uncertainty, and model uncertainty. The understanding of variability can be improved by collecting more data and improving the quality of data through training and quality control. Stress and model uncertainty remain a challenge in rock engineering.

##  Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis in Mining Industry
Risk assessments will help the mine operators to identify high, medium and low risk levels. Risk assessments will help to prioritise risks and provide information on the probability of harm arising and severity of harm by understanding the hazard, combine assessments of probability and severity to produce an assessment of risk and it is used in
