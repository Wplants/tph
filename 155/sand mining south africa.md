Sand as a unique natural resource should not be governed only by mining and minerals policy. A holistic policy is needed that regulates the activity and commerce of sand mining, and also protects water and land bodies where extraction takes place. To improve sand mining governance, Uganda should fill the legal gaps and properly regulate the market.
