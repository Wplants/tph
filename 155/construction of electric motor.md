##  Basic Motor Theory
The development of the electric motor has given us the most efficient and effective means to do work known to man. Because of the electric motor we have been able to greatly reduce the painstaking toil of man's survival and have been able to build a civilization which is now reaching to the stars. The electric motor is a simple device in principle.

## Induction Motor: Construction, Working principle & Advantages
It is because of the low cost, simple and rugged construction of the motor. Moreover, it has good operating characteristics with an efficiency as high as 90%. An induction motor does not have any commutator, like the one we saw in a DC motor. Hence it provides a good speed regulation without any sparking.

## Electric motor - 3D CAD Models & 2D Drawings - PARTcommunity
An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator, and generators and motors have much in common.. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor's magnetic field and winding currents to generate

## Linear Induction Motor : Construction, Working & Its Applications
Jul 6, 2022What is Linear Induction Motor : Working, Construction, & Its Applications. An induction motor is a generally used AC electric motor. In this motor, the electric current required within the rotor to generate torque is attained through electromagnetic induction from the stator winding's rotary magnetic field.
