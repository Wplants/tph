## Excavator Bucket Design and Durability | What you Need to Know - Kerfab
A dual radius excavator bucket design means the base of the bucket follows the teeth/edge through the material. This significantly reduces wear on the heel of the bucket. A dual radius shell is shaped so that the rear of the bucket has very little drag, therefore reducing the pressure on the substructure and underside of the excavator bucket.

## River Rock Vs Limestone For Landscaping - Just Yardz
River rock is an excellent choice for driveways, pathways, and landscapes. It has many benefits over crushed limestone, including being cheaper and easier to install. The main disadvantage of crushed limestone is its lack of cementious lime or another binding agent. It also will not produce a concrete finish.

Aug 27, 2022Limestone is typically not the best rock for beginner climbers but becomes better for climbing as the route difficulty increases. Lower grade limestone routes (5.10d and below) tend to have slick polished holds and sharp edges.

## Digging Post Holes in Solid Rock - Can it be Done?!?! - Auger Authority
How do you Dig Holes in Solid Rock? If you absolutely must drill into solid rock, the deeper the hole, the more labor and more expensive tools you'll need. For shallow holes, you can probably use a hammer drill. For deeper holes, you will need a jackhammer, a drifter drill and maybe, even dynamite. Careful with all of the above.

## Bucket Elevator for Limestone-online
Dear Shri Shrinivas Bartakke, The bucket elevator is handling 75 mm size limetsone. So firstly the bucket size should be suitable for this lump size. Preferably bucket speed should be low. Also lumpy limestone digging (scooping) resistance would be more and so bucket mounted on chain will be able to deal with the forces better.
