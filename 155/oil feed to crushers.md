## Oil Sand Feed Size Product Size Crusher
Oil Sand Feed Size Product Size Crusher. If a single-stage reduction is required, then depending on the feed-to-product-size ratio of reduction, either a single or double roll crusher can be selected.Regardless of the crusher type selected, roll crushers allow for the material to fracture along naturally occurring cleavage lines, which helps with minimizing fines generation.

crushers need a choke feed to utilize rock-on-rock crushing. And to main-tain a choke feed, the crusher must have the correct liner for the feed material. If coarse material is fed to a cone with a fine liner, the liner will wear unevenly near the top of the man-ganese. A feed that is too coarse will also result in low tons per hour, a
