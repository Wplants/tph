## User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction
These wastes can be subdivided into a number of categories: waste rock, mill tailings, coal refuse, wash slimes, and spent oil shale.  However, the specific gravity or unit weight of waste rock from the mining of iron ore and taconite will be considerably higher than that of conventional aggregates. The specific gravity of waste rock can be

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground.  Coal refuse (also described as coal waste, rock, slag, coal tailings, waste material, rock bank, culm, boney, or gob) is the material left over from coal mining, usually as tailings piles or spoil tips.

Jul 29, 2022Radiation Facts. Regardless of how uranium is removed from rock, the extraction process creates radioactive wastes. If not managed properly, mining waste and mill tailings can contaminate the environment. Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that has been mined and used for its chemical properties for more than a thousand years.

## Modeling acid mine drainage in waste rock dumps
Pyrite (FeS{sub 2}) is one of the most common naturally occurring minerals that is present in many subsurface environments. It plays an important role in the genesis of enriched ore deposits through weathering reactions, is the most abundant sulfide mineral in many mine tailings, and is the primary source of acid drainage from mines and waste rock piles.

Rock or Solid Mine Waste. Open pit mining has several stages of waste. First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore.

## Waste rock filling in fully mechanized coal mining for goaf-side entry 
A large amount of waste rock is generated during thin seam coal mining operations underground. The waste rock material stacked on surface also adds to the environmental pollution. So it is important to reduce the amount of waste rock by exploring gainful utilization methods. This paper deals with an investigation undertaken to develop an alternate gob filling material in laboratory and

Coal refuse (also described as coal waste, rock, slag, coal tailings, waste material, rock bank, culm, boney, or gob) is the material left over from coal mining, usually as tailings piles or spoil tips. For every tonne of hard coal generated by mining, 400 kilograms of waste material remains, which includes some lost coal that is partially economically recoverable.

## What Is Coal Refuse - ARIPPA
What Is Coal Refuse. Coal refuse is a legacy of previous coal mining and consists of low-quality coal mixed with rock, shale, slate, clay and other material. Also known as waste, culm, gob and boney, it was discarded as a "waste" during the original coal extraction process and randomly disposed in piles near the mine sites.

## Implementation of Paste Backfill Mining Technology in Chinese Coal Mines
Paste backfill mining (see Figure 1) is a coal mining method in which solid mining wastes such as gangues are broken and processed and then mixed with flyash, cementing materials, and water in a specific proportional basis. After that, the mixture is stirred, becoming coagulable paste slurry.
