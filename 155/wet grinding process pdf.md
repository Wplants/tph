## Process In Wet Grinding
 Wet Grinding, also known as wet milling, is a process of taking materials in a liquid form or slurry and reducing particles, such as agglomerates, by breaking them apart or shearing them down in size. Since the early 1800's companies have manufactured machines that were engineered to process wet materials. Contact

Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

Wet VS. Dry Grinding and Polishing - Bartell Global. The choice between wet and dry grinding and polishing is often personal preference. Sometimes people will choose to do a bit of both by starting with wet and switching to dry, but it still won't turn out quite the same because the slurry created by wet grinding is composed of abrasive particles, which will affect your process.

For wet grinding in the finer size ranges wet classifiers and/or cyclones are employed, generally to make a size separation from 20 mesh down to 325 mesh. Under dry grinding conditions air classifiers are used to make the size classification. Single stage grinding may be defined as grinding original feed to finished size in a single mill.

The moisture content of the slurry has a determining influence upon efficiency, an optimal value can always be found.
