## monocalcium phosphate manufacturing process
Dec 01, 2003· After a counter current purification process, the dihydrated dicalcium phosphate crystals are precipitated, separated, filtered and dried. The crystalline structure is unique to the HCl production process. The dicalcium phosphates is further used for the production of monocalcium phosphate at the factory in Ham.

## manufacturing process of dicalcium phosphate from rock
A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.

A process is provided for the production of dicalcium phosphate form a phosphate source material in which a solution of phosphoric acid is produced by the action of a suitable mineral acid, generally sulphuric acid, on a phosphate source material. Calcium fluoride is precipitated at a pH of between 3,5 and 4,5 followed by hydrolysing the solution by diluting it with water to a ratio of

## WOA1 - A process for the manufacture of feed grade dicalcium 
This invention relates to the preparation of feed grade dicalcium phosphate from a source containing monocalcium phosphate such as super phosphate, concentrated super phosphate and the like. The first step consists of leaching water soluble mono calcium phosphate therefrom with water or recycle wash water from one of the subsequent steps.
