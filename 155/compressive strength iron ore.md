## Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Model for Predicting the Cold Compressive Strength 
During the pellet production Cold Compressive strength should be monitored to control the process. For this an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was modelled in this paper using MATLAB ® toolbox to predict the cold compressive strength of the iron ore pellet.

## compressive strength iron
Effects of iron ore tailings on the compressive . Zhang et al. also found that when the iron ore tailings content ranged from 20% to 40%, the compressive strength was higher than that containing only manufactured sand. over, the compressive strength is influenced by the aggregate surface morphology .
