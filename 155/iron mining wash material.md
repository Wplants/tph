## Mining and the Environment: What Happens When A Mine Closes?
Mining activities increase the volume and rate of exposure of sulfur-containing rocks to air and water, creating sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. This acid run-off dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury which leach into ground water aquifers and surface water sources, harming humans and wildlife.

##  Conveyor Belt Solutions for every mining task - Continental Industry
Conveying bulk materials with extremely high temperatures of up to +800 °C or in environments with extremely low temperatures of up to -60 °C puts man and machine under great stress. This is where maximum temperature resistance is required to ensure material (e.g. iron ore pellets) does not burn through the conveyor
