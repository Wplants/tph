Tips to get more cash for your scrap metal. Copper is an element on the periodic table (Cu) and is pure metal. This means copper is a natural resource found in mines all over the world. Brass, on the other hand, is a metal alloy. Being a metal alloy means that it is made up of a combination of different elements and is not naturally occurring.

## Copper mining. From ore to copper..uk
About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores. A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper. It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations. The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue). The most common copper minerals are:
