Process Street doesn't do the ABPD aspect of process mining, but it can be employed to achieve the other two process mining goals highlighted in the overview above.. With Process Street you create templates of your processes and have users run them as checklists.This way, you can set employees to run a checklist every time they approach a task. You will then see whether they worked through

Mar 1, 2021Asteroid mining has the potential to be a very profitable industry . Sourcing nickel-iron family metals from asteroids has gained interest since 1977, and  A 1070-nm laser is demonstrated to reliably and robustly process olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, even at 100 W, the lowest power used in the present research project.

## Olivine - Rock-Forming Minerals - Sandatlas
Olivine is a common rock-forming mineral in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, but it also occurs in impure metamorphosed carbonate rocks (picture below). It is a very common mineral in the mantle. Some xenoliths from the mantle are almost entirely composed of this mineral. Such a rock type is known as dunite.

## Garden Guides | How Is Peridot Mined?
Peridot can be mined from underground deposits. Explosives can be used to get near the peridot but not beyond initial access because peridot grows in crystal layers. Timing is also a critical factor in mining peridot. For the Pakistani location, you would have to climb 15,000 feet into the Western Himalayas to reach the gems.

Mineral carbonation of basic silicate minerals regulates atmospheric CO2 on geological time scales by locking up carbon. Mining and spreading onto the earth's surface of fast-weathering silicates, such as olivine, has been proposed to speed up this natural CO2 sequestration ('enhanced weathering'). While agriculture may offer an existing infrastructure, weathering rate and impacts on soil
