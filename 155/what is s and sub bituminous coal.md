## Bituminous coal
Bituminous coal, or black coal, is a type of coal containing a tar-like substance called bitumen or asphalt.Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown; often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams.It is typically hard but friable.Its quality is ranked higher than lignite and sub-bituminous coal, but lesser than anthracite.

## When was sub bituminous coal formed?aroni
Sub bituminous coal is a lignite that has been subjected to an increased level of organic metamorphism. This metamorphism has driven off some of the oxygen and hydrogen in the coal. That loss produces coal with a higher carbon content (71 to 77% on a dry ash-free basis).

## About the Coal Industry
Coal is by far Canada's most abundant fossil fuel, with 6.6 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Canada has anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal deposits. More than 90% of Canada's coal deposits are located in western provinces, which provides a strategic advantage because of the close proximity of west coast ports.

Sub-bituminous coal: Sub-bituminous coal forms from the lignite gel that has been heated to at least 150 0 F. It is harder, blacker, and has a higher heat content than lignite. Wyoming's coal is sub-bituminous. Major reserves of sub-bituminous coal are also found in Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, and Alaska.

Bituminous coal. Bituminous coal is an organic sedimentary rock formed by diagenetic and sub metamorphic compression of peat bog material. It is also called as black coal. It is often referred to as soft coal. However, this designation is a layman's term and has little to do with the hardness of the rock.
