## Switching to Whole Wheat Flour - making the transitions easier
Use a Grain Mill to grind fresh flour. Use Hard WHITE Wheat. Here's the deal: I have NEVER liked store-bought whole wheat flour. Still don't like it very much. The idea of switching to whole wheat flour to me was NOT appealing and I DIDN'T want to. Until I had a piece of my friend's bread made with freshly ground hard white wheat flour.

## Which Wheat Makes the Best Wheat Flour for Bread - Don't Waste the Crumbs
THE CONCLUSION. When it comes to the recommendation of using hard red wheat for bread baking purposes, I believe it's accurate. The store-bought wheat did hold up well in the baking sense, but personally I attribute it to the ultra-fine flour that steel mills create. It was also likely ground from hard white wheat which has a bit more protein

1. Mounting to a solid surface. A manual grain mill must be mounted to a table or counter top. 2. Time. It takes much longer to grind up your flour with a manual mill than an electric one, especially if you need to grind up a large amount at one sitting. 3. Weight. Some manual grain mills weigh up to 20 pounds.

I mill my own flour. I've used both hard red winter wheat and hard white spring wheat. They taste different (red wheat has more flavor) but behave identically. I prefer to sieve my flour. I use two sieves, an 18-hole-per-inch (0.7mm?) standard kitchen sieve, then through a finer (0.5mm) honey strainer.

## How To Make Sprouted Wheat Flour - Weed 'em & Reap
Further, at 175° it loses the valuable enzymes you'd benefit from in sprouted grain flours. And yes, unless you have a grain mill or the equivalent it's hard to grind fine. You need soak the wheat berries for 3-5 hrs, drain and let sprout until the white buds split into two (draining 2x/day, of course).

## You Should Grind Your Own Flour - 4 HUGE Reasons
I have 5 favorites: Hard Red, Hard White (Prairie Gold), Spelt, Kamut & Soft white. Spelt & Kamut are "super grains." Very healthy. Hard red & hard white are great for loaf-style bread. When I make my loaf bread I use 4 C hard red, 4 C hard white & 2 C Spelt.
