## Manufactured Sand and Crushed Stones Processing Technology For Concrete 
Aggregate. Aggregate is the most exploited material in the world. It is an important component of concrete and asphalt concrete, accounting for 70% of the volume of concrete. It can inhibit the shrinkage and cracking of concrete and enhance the strength of concrete. Aggregates are divided into natural aggregates and artificial aggregates.
