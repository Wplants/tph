## Admixture or Additive?| Concrete Construction Magazine
When the same ingredient is added to a cement during the manufacturing process, the industry calls it an additive. If this isn't confusing enough, cement engineers refer to pozzolanic materials and hydraulic material other than portland cement as mineral admixtures. The reason is mineral admixtures have a different effect on the recipe.

To dim the initial set i.e. to keep the concrete in a working position for a longer time for placement. Also, to enhance workability. To improve the penetration (flowability) and permeability of concrete.

## Cement and Concrete: Environmental Considerations
Concrete is produced by mixing cement with fine aggregate (sand), coarse aggregate (gravel or crushed stone), water, and—often—small amounts of various chemicals called. admixtures that control such properties as setting time and plasticity. The process of hardening or setting is actually a chemical reaction called.
