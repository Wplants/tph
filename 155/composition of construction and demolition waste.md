## Recycled Aggregates from Construction Demolition Wastes -Types 
The CDW composition depends upon the type of demolition waste as well as the type of aggregate used for that construction. A typical construction and demolition waste aggregate is said to have 65-70% of major coarse as well as fine aggregates, with 30-35% of cement paste.

## Construction Waste Management | Construction & Demolition Waste 
Construction & Demolition Waste. The growth in the construction industry triggers waste production to exponential levels. The waste generated from the construction industry is commonly called as Construction & Demolition Waste or C&D waste. Most of the waste materials in construction industries are non-biodegradable and inert materials.. Construction waste materials are heavy, dense, bulky in

The indicators determined suggest that the average composition of waste generated on site is mostly concrete and ceramic materials. Specifically for new residential and new non-residential construction the production of concrete waste in buildings with a reinforced concrete structure lies between 17.8 and 32.9 kg m (-2) and between 18.3 and 40.

Mar 24, 2022The treatment of construction and demolition waste can take place in mobile or stationary plants. In the simplest technological variant, as implemented in mobile crushing plants (Fig. 4.1 left), the feed material is first separated into two fractions by pre-screening. The coarse material is then fed to the crusher to reduce the particle size.
