## Cobalt is critical for a renewable energy transition. How can we 
Another avenue being explored to reduce adverse impacts of cobalt extraction is improved recycling, which would reduce the need for mining in the first place. In February 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy invested in a pilot plant called the ReCell Center to explore cost-effective ways to reclaim the lithium and cobalt from lithium ion batteries.

## Cobalt Mining in the DRC: Outlook and Implications
Dwight Lindquist |Oct 16, 2019. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) holds vast reserves of mineral wealth. These resources include the world's largest reserves of cobalt, a metal with applications in many high-technology industries. Cobalt often occurs naturally alongside copper and nickel and can be obtained as a by-product of mining

a fourfold increase in cobalt demand before 2030.7 This growing demand means that companies reliant on lithium-ion batteries will need to source cobalt either directly or indirectly from the DRC. The development of potential new battery technology that reduces or entirely eliminates cobalt content from batteries will take time to develop and scale.

## Understanding the impact of deep-sea mining - MIT News
Currently, nickel and cobalt are extracted through land-based mining operations. Much of this mining occurs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which produces 60 percent of the world's cobalt. These land-based mines often impact surrounding environments through the destruction of habitats, erosion, and soil and water contamination.

Nov 6, 2021Human Rights Violations in DRC Mines. Cobalt mining in the DRC is rife with human rights abuses, such as the use of child labor. According to Amnesty International, an estimated 40,000 children are employed in artisanal mining in the DRC. A lack of proper safety precautions is also common practice and accidents frequently occur.

## Cobalt - Responsible Minerals Initiative
Demand for cobalt is expected to rise significantly over the coming years. Cobalt is extracted in mechanized and artisanal mining operations. Multiple reports have highlighted concerns over social and environmental impacts of cobalt extraction, including child labor and unsafe working conditions in artisanal cobalt mining.
