## 75-40mm Crushed Concrete - Mainland Aggregates
Other Name (s): Crushed Concrete, 75-40mm, Consists of: An aggregate composed of Crushed Concrete, Brick and occasional Asphalt which has been screened to remove the bulk of dust and fines. Sizes range from 75mm down to 40mm. This type of Crushed Concrete in mainly used as a sub-base or drainage layer where the presence of fines is un-desirable.

## What Is Bulk Density Of Concrete? | Knologist
Jun 1, 2022The density of hardened concrete is about 2,500 kg/m3. What Is The Density Of Crushed Aggregates? The density of crushed aggregates is the weight of a material per unit volume. It is a measure of how much material is in a given area. What Is Bulk Density Formula? Bulk density is a measure of the mass of a substance in terms of its total mass.

## The density of crushed stone - gravel, granite, limestone and slag 
The term "bulk density of crushed stone" is used forThe notation of the relation between mass and occupied volume, taking into account the free space between the particles. This parameter is necessary when calculating the composition of a concrete mixture.
