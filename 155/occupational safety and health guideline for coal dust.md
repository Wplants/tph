## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

## The Danger in Coal Dust - Identifying Threats
Jan 26, 2021The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted in the past that exposure to dust in coal mines can cause several lung diseases, including black lung, silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported that "From

## Coal Dust: What Is It, And Why Is It Dangerous?
Significant amounts of coal dust are produced in mines, and the environment tends to have less ventilation. These health effects can include increased risk for heart diseases and respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is another frequent result of exposure to coal dust.

This movement in different types of coal generates dust in transit to the discharge point. Conveyors are normally used on the shiploading jetty and it is important to operate the conveyor from the downwind side aligned to face into the wind, which also depends on the nature of

## Coal dust - Global Energy Monitor
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of coal, which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverizing of coal. Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal. Blasting at mountaintop removal (MTR) sites also expels coal dust and fly-rock into the air, which can disturb or settle onto nearby communities.

## Occupational safety and health
The research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon. As labor movements arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as a labor-related issue. [citation needed]In 1700, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba, outlined the health hazards of chemicals, dust, metals, repetitive or violent

## Coal Dust - Silica, Some Silicates, Coal Dust and para-Aramid Fibrils 
The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a long-term study of inhalation exposure to coal dust and/or diesel. In rats, exposure to coal dust (2 mg/m 3 for 7 h/day, 5 days/week, over 2 years) resulted in a chronic elevation of alveolar macrophages (Castranova et al., 1985).
