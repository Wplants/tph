## Contending with stockpile segregation, product quality - Quarry
A uniform aggregate product is essential to producing high quality asphalt or concrete. The fluctuating gradation of a segregated aggregate product makes it nearly impossible to produce an acceptable asphalt or concrete product. A given weight of smaller particles has a larger total surface area than the same weight of larger particles.
