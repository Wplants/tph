## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate in Concrete
With observation of 20% of quarry dust (7 days), the average compressive strength is 29.62 N/mm 2 whereas that for natural sand is 28.44 N/mm 2. For 25% quarry dust, the value increased to 30.81 N/mm 2. Finally, for 30% quarry dust, the strength increased to 32.88 N/mm 2.
