## Soil Stabilization using Crusher Dust - IJERT
The main objective of the soil stabilization is to increase the bearing capacity of the soil and maximum dry density. This paper assesses the stabilizing effect of crusher dust on the soil. Crusher dust is added to the soil at varying proportions like 20%, 30% and 40% by the weight of the soil sample throughout.

##  Changing pH in Soil - UC Davis
As the percentage of clay in a soil increases, it requires proportionately more limestone to raise the pH. This means it is much harder to change the pH of clay soil than sandy soil.

For a desired pH 6.5, the lime requirement is estimated as follows: If the exchangeable acidity is greater than 4.0, then: Lime requirement = exchangeable acidity x 840. If the exchangeable acidity is less than 4.0 and the soil pH is still less than 6.5, then: Lime requirement = 2,000 lb/A.

Soil pH should be measured at least once a year as a general practice. This can be done using any number of kits or through the use of a pH meter. The lower the pH, the more lime it will take to correct. For example, a soil with a pH of 4.5 will require significantly more lime to correct to 6.5 than a lawn with an initial pH of 6.0.
