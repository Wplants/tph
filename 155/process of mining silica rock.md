## Silica - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

Silica dust (crystalline silica) is found in some stone, rock, sand, gravel and clay. The most common form is quartz. Silica dust can also be found in the following products: bricks; tiles; concrete; some plastic material. When these materials are worked on, silica is released as a fine dust known as respirable crystalline silica or silica dust.
