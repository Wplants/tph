## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Dec 1, 2020Gold refining is a group of processes to pull out and set the precious metal apart from recycled elements (such as electronics and jewelry), mined materials, etc. The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process.. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity

A process for extracting gold from a gold-bearing ore. The process includes, first, providing a leaching liquor with thiosulfate anion and ethylenediamine. Next, the leaching liquor is contacted with the gold-bearing ore to form a pregnant leach solution including gold dissolved from the gold-bearing ore. Finally, at least part of the gold in the pregnant leach solution is recovered.

## Extraction of Metals - Methods of Extraction of Metals from Ores - BYJUS
Extraction of metals. The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground. The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception.
