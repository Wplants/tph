The production of sand fillers is simple because it includes, at most, only washing and classification into grades differing in grain size. Because sand has a negligible degree of porosity, it has an extremely low specific surface area in the range from 40 to 160 cm 2 /g. The material usually contains more than 99.7% SiO 2, with absorbed water being at a negligible level (0.1%).

## What is Silica Sand Used For? - YUNZE MINERAL
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed.
