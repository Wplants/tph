## Introduction to the Mill - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Advanced Work Holding Description Milling machines are very versatile. They are usually used to machine flat surfaces, but can also produce irregular surfaces. They can also be used to drill, bore, cut gears, and produce slots. The type of milling machine most commonly found in student shops is a vertical spindle machine with a swiveling head.

The principles of CNC operation. Movement of X, Y, Z axis are controlled by a motor which supplies either Alternating current or Direct current. Movement of the machine is done by giving commands. All the operations are carried out by codes like speed, feed, depth of cut, etc. For each operation separate code is available.

The two main parts of the milling machine are the head and the motor. The head carries the collets that hold the tools for milling an object. The movement of the head is upward and downward on a Z-axis while the motor spins the tools. The motor can either be a pulley system to vary the tool speed or a motor with variable speed.

## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE - Engineering Tutorials
Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating, cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling, slotting, making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## What is the Working Principle of the Flour Machine?
The operating principle of the flour mill: During the blade cutting and destruction process, the rotor generates high-speed airflow and rotates with the blade cutting direction, the material accelerates in the airflow, and repeated impacts cause the material to be destroyed in two layers together, speeding up the destruction rate of the
