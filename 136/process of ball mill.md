## mineral ball mills manufacturers, supplier
A ball mill mineral machine or a grinder is used in mines to grind material into a fine powder. The grinded materials are in turn used in mineral dressing process such as pyrotechnics, paints and ceramics. It mixes materials like ores and even ceramic raw materials by rotating in a round horizontal axis.

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T
