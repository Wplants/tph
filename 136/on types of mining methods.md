## What are the different types of mining methods? - Short-Facts
Primarily, there are two types of mining methods being used for the extraction of minerals and ores - surface/opencast mining and underground mining. What are the 4 steps of mining? The mining industry operates through a sequence of stages: exploration, discovery, development, production and reclamation.

Advanced Branch Mining. This type of branch mining is an extended version of variant 2 and is the most efficient form of horizontal mining. By careful placement of corridors, a ratio of 1:3 blocks mined to blocks exposed can be achieved. The advanced branch mining lay-out is one such attempt at maximising the amount of visible blocks per block

Longwall mining. Longwall mining is a type of caving, applied to a horizontal tabular deposit such as coal. While block and sublevel caving are essentially vertically advancing metal mining methods, longwall mining is applied to relatively thin and flat-lying deposits - most often coal, but occasionally an industrial mineral such as trona.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.

In this method, ore is mined in horizontal slices, starting from the bottom to the top of the stope. The broken ore is left in the mined-out stope and serves as a support to the stope walls and a working platform for mining the ore above. Shrinkage stoping has a high recovery but requires steep and narrow ore bodies.

Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

What are the different types of data mining? Categorically, data mining methods can range from pattern-based (clustering, classification, association) and anomaly-focused (outlier detection) to automated (neural networks, machine learning). In most cases, the type of data mining will depend on the entity using it and the data in question.

## Methods and Techniques of Uranium Mining | nuclear-power
As with other types of hard rock mining, there are several extraction methods. In the case of uranium mining, it strongly depends on the concentration of uranium in the ore. For example, the ore extracted from the Australian Olympic Dam Mine has a concentration of 0.05 %, and most reserves have uranium with a concentration of between 0.1 bis 0.2 %.

There are two different types of clustering, which are hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods. Non-hierarchical Clustering In this method, the dataset containing N objects is divided into M clusters. In business intelligence, the most widely used non-hierarchical clustering technique is K-means.

Development mining is the initial phase of removing the non-valuable components such as rock to access the targeted minerals. Production mining is the process of excavating the targeted ore after removing the unwanted materials.

Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.
