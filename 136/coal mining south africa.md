South Africa uses coal extensively. It is one of the few countries that synthesizes gasoline and diesel from coal.  It was a formidable task to model the entire coal value chain, from mining and benefaction through to electricity generation, synthetic fuels production or export, and ultimately to assess the impact on the economy and environment.
