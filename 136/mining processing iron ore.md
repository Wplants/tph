At the processing plant, the taconite is crushed into very small pieces by rock crushing machines. The crushers keep crushing the rock until it is the size of a marble. The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. Separation The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Iron Ore Processing in Mining Industry - StudyMoose
Many things are produced in the extracting or iron from iron ore in a blast furnace. The iron ore is reacted with carbon and oxygen in the furnace to produce carbon dioxide and iron metal. Carbon monoxide is also produced so that it can react with the iron ore to produce the iron. At the end, there is left the molten iron and the slag. The top

## Iron Ore Analysis & Process Optimization Solutions
Our solutions for on-line analysis (elemental and mineralogical) directly in the mine enable ore sorting and fast counteractions on changing iron ore composition to produce the optimal blend for downstream processing. This saves mining operations multiple millions in USD every month since iron ore beneficiation increases significantly the costs
