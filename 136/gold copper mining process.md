R-OH+Au (CN)2-═R-Au (CN)2+OH-. Gold extraction process flow. (1) Adsorption: When the gold-containing cyanide solution passes through the exchange resin column, an ion exchange reaction occurs, and gold is adsorbed on the resin. (2) Desorption: Desorbing the gold on the resin into the solution with a desorbent.

## SART Process for Gold Recovery and Cyanide Management : BQE Water
Gold recovery can become uneconomical when cyanide-soluble base metals such as copper and zinc are present in gold ore deposits. These metals form weak acid dissociable (WAD) complexes with the cyanide and preferentially competes for cyanide. The result is high cyanide consumption, poor gold doré purity and high concentrations of copper

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.
