## 3 Types of Rock: Igneous, Sedimentary & Metamorphic | AMNH
Three Types of Rock. Rocks fall into these three groups: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed from melted rock deep inside the Earth. Sedimentary rocks are formed from layers of sand, silt, dead plants, and animal skeletons. Metamorphic rocks formed from other rocks that are changed by heat and pressure underground.

## 2.3 Mineral Groups - Physical Geology
2.3 Mineral Groups Most minerals are made up of a cation (a positively charged ion) or several cations and an anion (a negatively charged ion (e.g., S 2-)) or an anion complex (e.g., SO 4 2-). For example, in the mineral hematite (Fe 2 O 3), the cation is Fe 3 + (iron) and the anion is O 2- (oxygen). We group minerals into classes on the basis of their predominant anion or anion group.

Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.

A rock is a solid made up of a bunch of different minerals. Rocks are generally not uniform or made up of exact structures that can be described by scientific formulas. Scientists generally classify rocks by how they were made or formed. There are three major types of rocks: Metamorphic, Igneous, and Sedimentary.
