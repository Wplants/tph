The first stamp mill in the U.S. was built in 1829 at the Capps mine near Charlotte, North Carolina. They were common in gold, silver, and copper mining regions of the US in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, in operations where the ore was crushed as a prelude to extracting the metals. They were superseded in the second half of the 19th

## What are Tailings - Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration
Tailings are a by-product of mining. After ore containing an economically-recoverable commodity is mined from the earth, that commodity is extracted in a processing plant or mill. After the commodity of value is extracted from the ore material, the resultant waste stream is termed "tailings". Typically, mill tailings range from sand to silt

Tailings are natural, finely ground rock or sand that remains after economic minerals have been removed. At Copper Mountain, the ore body is a low sulfidation, carbonate-hosted copper deposit. This is important as the naturally high percentage of carbonate, compared to the naturally low presence of sulfur, results in the tailings from our mine
