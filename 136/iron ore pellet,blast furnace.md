## Iron Oxide Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production).

## Optimum Pellet Basicity Desirable for Blast Furnace Operation
The stability of blast furnace process depends upon the quality of raw materials charged into the furnace. Among iron-bearing materials, pellets are an important feed material for the blast furnace operation. However, pellets exhibit swelling inside the blast furnace due to the high temperature inside the furnace, which causes dissociation of pellets and if swelling index is not controlled

Vale is the world's biggest producer of iron ore and pellets, raw materials essential to the manufacture of steel. Iron ore is found in nature in the form of rocks, mixed with other elements.  On top of this, the ore needs to be strong enough not to be crushed thereby obstructing the blast furnace. Thus, the production of pellets is

## Estimation of Iron Ore Pellet Softening in a Blast Furnace with  - MDPI
Aug 31, 2021In blast furnaces it is desirable for the burden to hold a lumpy packed structure at as high a temperature as possible. The computational thermodynamic software FactSage (version 7.2, Thermfact/CRCT, Montreal, Canada and GTT-Technologies, Aachen, Germany) was used here to study the softening behavior of blast furnace pellets. The effects of the main slag-forming components (SiO2, MgO, CaO and

The pellets are now ready for shipping by train to customers or to ore docks. They are sent to blast furnaces and steel mills, where they will be turned into finished steel. A trainload of iron ore pellets bound for the blast furnace National Steel Pellet Company's iron ore pellets have the following characteristics (FOB Mine):

## The world faces a $2tn bill to make steel green by 2050. High grade 
The company says its 66.2% concentrate reduces emissions in the blast furnace steelmaking process, while its >67.5% pellet feed concentrate can be used in electric arc furnaces which normally require scrap steel as a feed source, 50% less emissions intense than blast furnaces. Champion Iron has built on its success to fund its Bloom Lake II
