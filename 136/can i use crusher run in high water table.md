## 6 Facts to Know Before Using a Track-Mounted Crusher
Nov 18, 20202. Track-mounted crushers work at lower volumes. Stationary plants, often running over 1,000 HP, are great for crushing high volumes of material, but they're built for longer-term applications and more are difficult to adapt. Track-mounted crushers usually run closer to HP, and so they don't produce as many tons per hour.

## The water table and your garden - what it is and how to work with it
Water clings to the soil molecules by surface tension. Some water is drawn back up to the surface through capillary action (heat causes water on the surface to evaporate, pulling deeper molecules up behind it). This zone is closest to the surface. Water table: the line at which the saturated zone meets the unsaturated zone.

We will use between 15-30 yards of ¾' crushed stone in a pool dig with a high water table. The material you are digging in will determine how much stone you will need. If the soil is tight like clay then you will not need as much stone to dewater the hole. The tighter the soil the less it will clog the stone as the ground water runs through it.
