## Opal Mines - Black Opal Direct
Opal mining equipment gets put through some pretty rough treatment, and breakdowns are common, leaving the miner to earn some more money by getting a job to repair their mining equipment and keep mining later. People live out on the opal fields on residential claims called camps. Most of the camps are made from corrugated iron, caravans or old

## Mining Opal
The general rule for opal mining is the ground substructure produces an "opal level" every 10 feet in depth, however, this rule of thumb does not always apply to White Cliffs soil as opal can be found at any level. Miners do generally stick to this rule when mining as it gives a secure band of dirt between the drives (horizontal tunnelling) on

## Lightning Ridge: The World Capital of Fine Black Opal
Opal was discovered in Lightning Ridge in the late 1880s, but its value was not recognized until Charlie Nettleton sank the first shaft in 1903 and sold the first parcel of black opal later that year. The town dramatically expanded with the influx of miners from White Cliff, another world-famous opal mining area in Australia.

The largest form of opal mining is called Open cut mining. This is when large excavating equipment is used to remove the overburden from the surface. It is still a fairly delicate process to sort through the promising material due to the fact that the opal can be easily damaged. I'll go into some of my past experiences in future blogs.

As far back as 4,000 BCE, humans have treasured opals and mined them in various locations, such as Kenya and Hungary. However, due to an unlikely combination of geology, fortuitous finds, and the two world wars, Australia has become the world's primary source of opal since the 1880s.
