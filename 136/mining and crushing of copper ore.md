If the rocks do not drop, they are sorted and crushed with a rock crusher . The rock is then dumped into an ore bin until being fed through ore bin gates into an ore feeder, then into the stamp mortar. When the rock runs through the stamp battery, the finely crushed mixture is washed over a series of copper plates coated with mercury

Inside the mill, the ore is mixed with water in two rotating SAG mills which use the larger rocks and 8-inch steel balls to reduce the ore to about 10 mm or smaller. Then two ball mills grind the ore to about 0.2 mm with 3-inch steel balls. This copper ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation deck. Asarco milling link -rotary mills.

The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.

Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to

ABSTRACT Mining consumes approximately 7% of the world's energy from which almost half goes for comminution. Since the crushers are more energy efficient than mills, it is logic to push down-sizing in crushing stage (s) as far as possible. That has been Sandvik's strategy in supplying crushers, in 25-Nov-2015.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## How Is Copper Ore Mining Crushing
Copper Mining And Processing Processing Of Copper Ores. B Processing of Sulfide Ore Following mining transporting and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ballsize the crushed ore is further processed at a mill using secondary crushers and reduced to pebbles and finally to fine sand After the copper ore is crushed liquid is added to make it
