## The Use of Mercury in Gold Mining - Right for Education
Dec 8, 2020Mercury is a silvery metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is used in gold mining to extract gold from rocks. A puddle of mercury is poured onto a pile of crushed rock. The mercury and the rock are then mixed. Any gold will leave the rock and stick to the mercury to form blobs. The mercury is then blowtorched and it evaporates (turns

## Gold mining causes serious mercury pollution
Currently, the amount of mercury used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining is estimated at 1,400 tons per year, more than any other use of mercury.

To recover the gold from the amalgam, the solid is heated to vaporize the mercury and separate it from the gold. The heating can be accomplished with a hand torch or a stove. This mercury distillation step in the mining process is when exposure to mercury gas occurs and the emissions are emitted into the atmosphere.

## Reducing Mercury Pollution from Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.

Gold mining has historically formed a vital plank in the economies of Yukon and Alaska. While a number of small gold rushes occurred in both regions during the latter half of the 19 th century, the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890's and the subsequent Alaskan gold rushes of the 1900's put both regions on the map as a hub for gold mining and settlement.

Small-scale gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon poses a health hazard not only to miners but also to nearby communities. Contrary to common assumption that communities closest to mining bear the brunt of exposure, new evidence shows that the highest non-occupational mercury exposures occur in native communities hundreds of kilometers away from mining.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
