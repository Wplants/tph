## Steel production: from iron ore to functional industrial products. - Vepica
How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.

and Pellets. Vale is the world's biggest producer of iron ore and pellets, raw materials essential to the manufacture of steel. Iron ore is found in nature in the form of rocks, mixed with other elements. By means of various industrial processes incorporating cutting-edge technology, iron ore is processed and then sold to steel companies.

Here are a few benefits of using Ozone (O3) in an iron filter: It is relatively better and acts faster than other oxidants like chlorine. It removes iron from the water efficiently. It also helps in eliminating the rotten egg odor caused by sulfur. It does not require the use of any other chemicals. It is eco-friendly.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
