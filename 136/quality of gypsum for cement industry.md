## India - Gypsum demand and supply - Cement Lime Gypsum - ZKG
India is depleting the mineable gypsum, but has total recoverable ­cement and plaster grade gypsum reserves of 54 million tons of gypsum (as per 2005). The majority of this is located in ­Rajasthan (over 97 % of the total reserves). India produced around 16 million tons of gypsum during, an average of around 3-3.5 million t/a.

Note how soft the gypsum is below the top of the hardened surface. Gypsum is severely affected by moisture. When it comes in to contact with moisture the calcium sulfate (gypsum) particles will expand and soften. For this reason, it is not recommended for use directly over concrete or anywhere moisture is anticipated.

CEMENT & POP INDUSTRY. Gypsum (a bi-product of salt) is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.

## Gypsum Is Essential and Necessary to Cement | Fote Machinery
It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.
