## Georgia Mining Association - Georgia Kaolin Mining
Kaolin is one of the many industrial minerals mined in Georgia today. The commercially mineable kaolin deposits are found in a relatively narrow "belt" along the Fall Line. The kaolin mining industry has located its processing facilities in the communities near the deposits, primarily in the nine rural counties between Macon and Augusta.

In the dry process, the raw material is crushed to the desired size, dried in rotary dryers, pulverized, and air-floated to remove most of the coarse grit. Wet processing of kaolin begins with blunging to produce a slurry, which then is fractionated into coarse and fine fractions using centrifuges, hydrocyclones, or hydro-separators.

A method for reducing the viscosity and for refining crude kaolin clays is disclosed. The inherent viscosities or crude kaolin clay ores, particularly those having acceptable optical and purity properties for use in preparing paper coating pigments, but normally rejected because of their high inherent viscosities, are significantly reduced by contacting an aqueous slurry of the crude clay with

Hydraulic mining comprises three processes of hydraulicking, sluicing, and educing. Hydraulicking. It is a process of using a big water cannon (often called a "giant" or a "monitor") to break up the mineral deposits and suspend them in a slurry. Sluicing. It is a process of moving or channeling the slurry to the sluice boxes or other places.
