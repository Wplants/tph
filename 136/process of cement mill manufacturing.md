## The Manufacturing Process of Cement in Factory | Mir Cement
Depending on the manufacturer's process, the grinding is done wet, dry, or semi-dry. In vertical shaft ball mills, 65% of the particles are smaller than 45 microns, and the balls used are around 12mm in size. The rotational speed can vary between 60 - 80 RPM. A typical ball mill can generate 3500 tons of cement per hour.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - All About Engineering
In the process of manufacturing cement, the first step is the crushing of raw materials. These raw materials contain limestone and clay or shale. Usually, the material is crushed in a tube mill. In the tube mill, there are steel balls. This process can be done in wet or dry conditions depending on the product in use but in dry process, the

## Coal Mill in Cement Plant | Vertical Roller Mill & Air-Swept Ball Mill
The ball mill is a traditional coal pulverizer machine, which has been widely used since it was invented. In the cement plant, the new dry process cement manufacturing requires the moisture content of coal powder to be 0.5% ~ 1.5%, while that of raw coal is 1.5% ~ 4.0%. Therefore, the ball mill should have a drying function besides grinding.

A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.
