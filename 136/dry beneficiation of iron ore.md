paramagnetic minerals such as iron and magnetite. High intensity magnetic separators (HIMS) generally have field strengths of 10 to 20 kilogauss. These separators are used to treat weakly magnetic minerals, such as hematite. Magnetic separators are commonly classified into two broad groups, namely, wet and dry based on their usage.

## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.
