A Copper deposit is a resource node and are found in the Black Forest biome and require an Antler Pickaxe or better to harvest them. Fully mining a deposit requires significant terraforming. They always have the same layout with 130 nodes which extend deep underground. Each node has 50 health.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.
