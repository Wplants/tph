## Crushers: Breaking Down the History of these Machines
Blake's design, which utilized a toggle linkage construction, was known as the Blake Jaw Crusher. Blake's crusher was announced in 1857 and patented in 1858. Perhaps surprisingly, the same basic design is still in use today for rock crushers. In the years following the design of the Blake Jaw Crusher, another type of crusher was designed.

Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
