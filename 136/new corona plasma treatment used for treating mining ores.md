Convalescent Blood Plasma Therapy. When people become infected and ill from a virus and then get better (convalesce), their immune system has successfully produced antibodies to fight that virus. Doctors have used forms of antibody therapy for over a hundred years in medical treatment. In 2020, the FDA granted an EUA for plasma antibodies.
