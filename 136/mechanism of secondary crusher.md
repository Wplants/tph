## mechanism of primary and secondary cone crusher
Apr 03, 2015 A gyratory crusher is used both for primary or secondary crushing. Cone crusher Cone crusher is consisting of a crushing chamber, a crushing cone and a operating mechanism. The cone is built in to a vertical shaft, which is supported from the top with a bowl-shaped bearing and from the other end to an eccentric operating mechanism.

The secondary crushers are also designed on the principle of gyratory crushing, but the construction details vary. Similar to jaw crushers, the mechanism of size reduction in gyratory crushers is primarily by the compressive action of two pieces of steel against the rock. As the distance between the two plates decreases continuous size

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
