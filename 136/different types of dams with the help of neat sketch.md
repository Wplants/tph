## What Is Piezometers?- Types, Functions, And Working
Types, Functions, And Working. A piezometer is a geotechnical sensor used to measure pore water pressure (piezometric level) in the ground. Designed to measure pore water pressure in soil, earth/rock, foundations and concrete structures. Piezoelectric or pore pressure gauges provide important quantitative data on the magnitude and distribution
