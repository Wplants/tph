That's enough to make 20 gold pieces from a ton of ore, so if we discount the costs of refining and minting, 100 pounds of unrefined gold ore should be worth about 1gp, give or take a few coppers. Yeah, that's not much fun. I suggest making something about the ore "special" to increase its value, or substituting another reward.

That would make the gold in a one pound ore sample worth approximately 75 cents, and this is assuming that the ore is extremely rich. Many mines can run profitably on much lower grade ores, which might easily reduce the average value of ore down to 25 cents or less per pound.
