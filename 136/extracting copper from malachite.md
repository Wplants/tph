## Extracting Copper from Malachite - Marked by Teachers
Introduction. Chemistry Extracting Copper from Malachite We extracted Copper from Malachite using a displacement reaction. Although electrolysis can also be used. We used 5g of malachite and dissolved it in sulphuric acid; this was to separate the sand and the copper, because the copper dissolves into the solution but the sand remains separate.

The present work describes an investigation of a chemical process for the recovery of copper and iron from malachite ore. For the dissolution of copper and iron, H 2 SO 4 was employed as well as H 2 O 2 as an oxidizing agent. The effects of reaction temperature and time, acid concentration, liquid-to-solid ratio and agitation rate on the copper and iron percentage were investigated.
