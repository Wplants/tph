## Harmonics Causes & Effects | Electrical India Magazine
Transformers: Harmonics in transformers cause an increase in the iron and copper losses. Voltage distortion increase losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents and causes overstressing of the insulation material used. The primary effect of power line harmonics in transformer is, thus the additional heat generated.

## How Coal Affects Water Quality: State of the Science
Ahrens and Morrisey were able to identify several studies that examined the effects of coal dust pollution on fish and shellfish. Unfortunately, most of the studies are old, poorly designed, or inconclusive. For example, a 1963 study found that coal washery solids in relatively low concentrations reduced the growth rate of exposed trout.

## Understanding Power System Harmonics and their Effects
Harmonics are quite simply, multiples of the fundamental power frequency. They have been around since the advent of non-linear or discontinuous loads. We can go back to the early 20th Century and the advent of the vacuum tube, for example, to identify some of the first power quality issues. However, even with the early problems, they were of such minimal effect that they were mostly ignored.

Environmental Impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite. Pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulphuric acid and dissolved iron, and as water washes through mines, this compound forms a dilute acid, which

For example, with a 50Hz fundamental frequency, we can expect harmonics at 100Hz, 150Hz, 200Hz, and so on. Having defined it, we shall now see its relevance in electrical systems.
