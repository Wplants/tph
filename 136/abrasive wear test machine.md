## Laboratory abrasive wear tests: investigation of test methods and alloy 
Laboratory abrasive wear tests are frequently classified by the type of test equipment used; however, they can be classified in more general terms by the stress level and the geometrical arrangement of the components of the system . If the load is sufficient to fracture the abrasive particles, the wear is called high-stress abrasive wear; if

## Abrasive Wear - About Tribology
Abrasive wear is the type of wear mechanism that results in the disintegration of the material on the surface due to the influence of the hard particle in contact with the surface. It also occurs when a hard surface or particles interacts or slides on the soft surface and causes material loss [1]. This is a type of the wear that occurs due to
