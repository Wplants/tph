## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete properties and performance with respect to workability, durability

Hence the mason are not ready to work with machine made crushed stone sand. For the same reason inferior river sand may be used. Manufacturing sand from jaw crusher, cone crusher, roll crusher often contains high percentage of dust and have flaky particle.

Some of Mix is - 5.5. Where, M = Mix. 20 = Characteristic Compressive strength. Consider volume of concrete = 1m3. Dry Volume of Concrete = 1 x 1.54 = 1.54 m3 (For Dry Volume Multiply By 1.54) Now we start calculation to find Cement, Sand and Aggregate quality in 1 cubic meter of concrete.
