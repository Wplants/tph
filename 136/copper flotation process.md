## Mineral Flotation - International Mining (2022)
Flotation has been at the heart of the mineral processing industry for over 100 years, addressing the 'sulphide' problem of the early 1900s, and continues to provide one of the most important tools in mineral separation today.  In a lot of these situations it is not a matter of 'bigger is better', that will make the process work, but

## Lower-pH Copper Flotation Reagent System | Department of Energy
A new reagent system, developed by Versitech, Inc., with assistance from DOE's Inventions and Innovation Program, recovers copper minerals at a much lower pH than conventional reagents and avoids floating pyrite. The process reduces or even eliminates both the lime used in copper flotation and the accompanying carbon dioxide.

## What Are Flotation Methods for Polymetallic Sulfide Ore I
When the ore is low in sulfur, copper flotation is the same as for single copper sulfide minerals. (2) Cu-Fe priority - mixed flotation. For copper and iron ore with more iron sulfide minerals, priority and mixed flotation process are generally used, and the lime method is usually used to suppress floating copper.

The intercept is zero, because the adjustment led to the regression line passing through the zero value. It must be borne in mind that, although we study a specific flotation process for copper ores, its oxidized degree can vary within a range. Therefore, the range of copper grades in the feed was also chosen as independent variables for its study.

## USA - Flotation process for copper ores and copper  - Google
A flotation process in which copper ores or copper converter slags are ground and firstly have added thereto benzotriazole or alkyl benzotriazole as an activator and secondly one or more collectors selected from the group consisting of xanthates, dithiophosphates, thiocarbamate esters, dithiocarbamates, mercaptans and dixanthogens and further, if desired, a promoter such as kerosene, light oil

## Development of copper recovery process from flotation tailings by a 
The total copper recovered from its ore through flotation process is about 56% [6,18], which indicates that the flotation tailings still contain valuable copper components such as chalcopyrite. In addition, old flotation tailings sometimes have a higher copper grade (0.2-0.4%) than that of lowâgrade ores (0.2â0.3%).
