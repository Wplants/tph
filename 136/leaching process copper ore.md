Heap Leaching is an ancient process; leaching metals out of ore goes back nearly 500 years. Mines in Hungary recycled copper-bearing solutions through waste heaps in the 1550s, Spanish miners percolated acid solutions through large heaps of oxide copper ore on the banks of the Rio Tinto in 1752 and one of the classical methods for the manufacture of copperas (iron sulphate) was to heap up iron

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

The process of Leaching is used to concentrate the ore. The ore of the metal is made to react with a suitable chemical reagent leading to the dissolution of only the metal, leaving behind the impurities which remain undissolved. The solution so obtained is a compound of the metal that can be further processed to extract the pure metal.

In addition, it is important to understand any variability of different zones of the ore body to the leach conditions, particularly material that will be fed during the early stages of operation.

## Producing Copper Nature's Way: Bioleaching
The GEOCOAT™ Process - A heap leaching process that is capable of bioleaching copper concentrates. It does this by coating the concentrate slurry onto a support rock, or substrate material, and stacking this coated material in a bioxidation heap. The support rock itself may be a low-grade copper ore.
