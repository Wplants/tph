In this route of iron making, the use of noncoking coal or natural gas is made as reductant for iron ore. The oil is used for heat hardening of iron ore pellets which is generally exploited by gas-based DRI plants. The coal-based DRI units generally require lump ore which need some electrical energy during crushing and sizing operations.
