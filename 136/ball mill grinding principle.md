## Ball Mill Basic Design Principles-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
Design and operating principle. A ball mill is a hollow drum rotating around its horizontal axis. It is filled with grinding balls (impact elements). As a result of rotation, balls on the internal drum surface lift and then fall down under the gravity action. The source material is permanently fed through one of spigots.

Principles of Grinding in Ball Mills. Action inside a Ball Mill drum is not a haphazard process. Stirring is not random nor is the throwing of the charge. There is a very specific operating speed for the most efficient grinding. Depending upon the Mill's speed, there is a point in which the load along the wall of the cylinder will break free

Nov 27, 2020 A ball mill rotates its long shaft, and drive a jar which is placed on it. The friction of the rubber surface of the shaft can rotate the jar. The grinding beads (grinding balls) in the jar will constantly hit the sample due to gravity and mechanical force. After a long period of rotation and impact, the sample gradually changes from large pieces to small pieces, and small pieces
