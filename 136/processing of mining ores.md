## Mining | National Geographic Society
May 20, 2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Score: 4.3/5 (28 votes) . Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.  Ores must be processed to extract the elements of interest from the waste rock.

A single blast can break approx. 3,000 tonnes of ore. Once the ore is broken, excavators load the ore into haul trucks and transport it to a primary ore crusher where the diamond extracting process begins. The Kimberley Big Hole is an example of open-pit mining. In underground mining, miners tunnel through Earth's crust to the kimberlite pipe
