## Cement Analysis and Production Information - Thermo Fisher Scientific
The cement production process. The cement production process begins with the extraction of limestone and clay from the quarry. The material is then blended, crushed and fed to the kiln. Post-kiln, the clinker is cooled and goes through a final grinding method before it is ready to ship. Portland cement, the most common type of cement, is

The main features of these cement ingredients along with their functions and usefulness or harmfulness are given below: Lime: Lime is calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide. The presence of lime in a sufficient quantity is required to form silicates and aluminates of calcium. Deficiency in lime reduces the strength of the property to the cement.

## Cement Manufacturing Industries and Plants - Civil Engineering
Among these countries, China alone manufactures about 45% of the total worldwide production of cement. It is a non-recyclable product and so every new construction or repair needs new cement, thus global consumption continues to rise. Especially in the economies of Asia and Eastern Europe, cement production is an important element of progress.

Material is directly conveyed to the silos (silos are the large storage tanks of cement) from the grinding mills. Further, it is packed to about 20-40 kg bags. Only a small percent of cement is packed in the bags only for those customers whom need is very small. The remaining cement is shipped in bulk quantities by mean of trucks, rails or ships.

Cement is many times stronger than clay and lime. Cement stays for a long time without damage if stored properly. It helps to speed up the construction process because its production does not require much time compared to some other materials. It can be produced from widely available materials. It is a little cheaper than some other materials.
