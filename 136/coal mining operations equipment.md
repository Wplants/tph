Coal mining takes place either underground or through surface/ opencast operations. The method used depends on the geology of the coal deposit.  Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors
