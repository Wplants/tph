## Optimal Control for Thermal Energy Efficiency of the Cement Clinker 
The improvement of thermal energy efficiency of the cement clinker manufacturing process can be achieved at macro energy control levels. Variable coal feeding rate (VCFR) control is proposed to improve thermal energy efficiency of the cement clinker manufacturing process. The current implementations mainly focus on process control or equipment control without considerations of energy

## Q&A: Why cement emissions matter for climate change
Three of these are the strategies previously being pursued by the cement industry to limit emissions, namely, improved energy efficiency, lower-emission fuels and lower clinker ratios. For example, the roadmap sets a target average global clinker ratio of 0.60 by 2050, down from 0.65.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## Best ways to cut carbon emissions from the cement industry explored 
The cement production process. Cement production is energy intensive, requiring 3.3 Gigajoules of thermal energy per ton of clinker - so another source of carbon in the industry is the way plants are powered. Instead of using carbon-intensive fossil fuels, manufacturers could use carbon-neutral biomasses.

## Concrete application of clinker-efficient cements | Advances in Cement 
The performance of clinker-efficient cements with granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and limestone beyond the limits of the current DIN EN 197-1 was examined. Fresh, mechanical and durability properties of concretes made with laboratory and plant cements were determined. It can be stated that cements with a clinker content of about 50 wt% using GGBS and a limestone content of up to 20 wt

is manufacturing cement {ordinary portland cement (OPC), portland pozzolana cement (PPC), Portland Slag Cement(PSC)} & clinker. The project activity is to upgrade the clinker cooler for energy efficiency in the cement manufacturing process. GCR Plant was commissioned in 1995 with the best available technology by the FLS, Germany.
