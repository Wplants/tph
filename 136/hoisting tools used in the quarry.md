## Hoisting Safety | OSHA Safety Manuals
Hoisting Safety. Hoisting is used to lift and lower loads using a drum or wheel with ropes or chains wrapped around it. Hoists can be powered manually, electrically, or pneumatically. Hoists effectively move heavy and/or awkward equipment, but they require training and safe work procedures. To operate a hoist, you must be properly trained.
