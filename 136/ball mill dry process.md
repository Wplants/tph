## Ball Mill Parameter Selection & Calculation - JXSC
1 Calculation of ball mill capacity. The production capacity of the ball mill is determined by the amount of material required to be ground, and it must have a certain margin when designing and selecting. There are many factors affecting the production capacity of the ball mill, in addition to the nature of the material (grain size, hardness, density, temperature and humidity), the degree of

## Ball Mill - Eastman Rock Crusher
Capacity. 1-1120t/h. Output size. 10-350mm. Ball mill is a type of grinder machine which uses steel ball as grinding medium, can crush and grind the materials to 35 mesh or finer, adopted in open or close circuit. The feed materials can be dry or wet, they are broken by the force of impact and attrition that created by the different sized balls.

## Dry Ball Mill VS Wet Ball Mill: What Are the Differences and How to Choose?
The wet ball mill has the following features: strong adaptability to materials, continuous production, large crushing ratio, easily fineness adjustment, high grinding efficiency, and low requirements for ore moisture content. In addition, the material transportation device is simple, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than dry ball mills.

Ball Mill Explained . For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum''s volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as '' slurry ''.
