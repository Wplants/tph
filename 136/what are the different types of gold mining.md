Hard Rock Mining. Hard rock mining is the process of extracting gold from deep within the earth.. Hard rock mining includes all types of deposits, including lode mines and placer mines. Hard rock mining requires heavy machinery, specialized tools, power equipment, significant financing, and workers to extract gold ore safely while creating minimal environmental impact.

There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's surface and the capacity of each method to profitably extract the resource. Each mining method also has varying

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

In placer mining, there are fundamentally two kinds of sampling: 1) Discovery: Attempting to locate a higher-grade deposit of value inside of a larger volume of lower-grade material. 2) Quantification: Extracting and analyzing smaller portions, to gain a perception of how much value exists within a larger volume.
