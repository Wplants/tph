## Diamond Grinding: Interstate Improvement
The most immediate effect of diamond grinding is a significant improvement in the riding smoothness of a pavement. Another very important effect of diamond grinding is the significant increase in surface macro-texture and consequent noise reduction and safety improvement. Safety is improved by a temporary increase in skid friction resistance

## Factors affecting proper coolant application when grinding
Bernoulli's energy equation can be used to predict the pressure that creates the desired jet velocity. For example, a grinding wheel moving at 12,000 sfm (3,657 m/min.) requires a nozzle pressure close to 270 psi (18.6 bar) for the coolant jet to match the wheel speed. Lower wheel speeds require lower pressures.
