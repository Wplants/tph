## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

The Stockholm Environment Institute concluded that the mining lowered river levels by more than 3 feet, while contributing to both coastal erosion and an invasion of saltwater into the delta, where it was poisoning rice fields. Ironically, much of the sand was being used to maintain coastal defenses and raise delta roads above flood levels.
