Function: A cement mill is a drive used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills. Process: Raw materials are fed to the mill in right proportion with the help of weighfeeders.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are recombined into new compounds. The result is called clinker, which are rounded nodules between 1mm and 25mm across. The clinker is ground to a fine powder in a cement mill and mixed with gypsum to create cement.

The proportioning of cement raw materials is not all the same but should be determined according to the actual situation. The proportion of raw materials of different specifications of cement is also different. Generally, the proportion of components in cement raw materials is 67-75% limestone, 10-15% clay, 0.5-1.5% iron ore and 8.5-11% coal.

## The cement mill - Understanding Cement
Cement manufacturing -brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.
