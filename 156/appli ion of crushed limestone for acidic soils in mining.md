## Understanding the role of limestone in soil acidity management
Some plants thrive in acidic soils, while others cannot tolerate acid and will prefer a basic environment. As a result, it is important to understand which species are more sensitive to soil acidity. To reduce soil acidity and help neutralize its negative effects, you can add natural limestone, in a fine granular or powder form.

Soil acidity is measured in pH units. Soil pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the soil solution. The lower the pH of soil, the greater the acidity. pH is measured on a logarithmic scale from 1 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A soil with a pH of 4 has 10 times more acid than a soil with a pH of 5 and 100 times more acid than a

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? | Questions | Naked 
Yes, limestone reacts with acids. Limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Carbonates react with acids according to the equation: However, the rate of the reaction will be determined by a number of factors. First, the strength of the acid. A strong acid, like hydrochloric acid, which readily ionises to produces a high concentration of hydrogen

Ag Lime, or agricultural lime, is a soil conditioner made from crushed limestone or dolomitic limestone. Ag lime works by dissolving and releasing a base that lowers the acidity of the soil. For crops growing in less-than-ideal acidity conditions, aglime can boost a farmer's profit potential by providing a number of benefits, including

Some plants are more sensitive to acid soil conditions than others. It is important to understand which species are more sensitive to soil acidity so limestone inputs may be made at the appropriate time. Soil pH is a measure of hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in the soil solution and is used to indicate whether a soil needs any limestone.

Although allspice is planted on a wide range of soils, a well-drained, fertile, loam limestone soil with a pH of 6-8 suits the crop best. Pimento grows well in semi-tropical lowland forests with a mean temperature of 18-24 °C, a low of 15 °C and a maximum of 32 °C.
