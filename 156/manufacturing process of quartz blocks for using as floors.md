## Quartz Power Manufacturing Process
The production process from raw quartz to solar cells involves a range of steps starting with the recovery and purification of silicon followed by its slicing into utilizable disks - the silicon wafers - that are further processed into ready-to-assemble solar cells. Only few manufacturers control the whole value chain from quartz to solar.

A block of quartz is a mineral block used for decoration. It can be turned into a chiseled quartz block, quartz pillar or quartz bricks. Blocks of quartz can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Four quartz blocks generate naturally as part of each bridge bastion remnant. Master-level mason villagers sell both a quartz block for an emerald and a quartz
