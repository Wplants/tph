Alluviums are thin deposits, in the form of layers, made of material transported by flowing waters, sediments on the bottom of the riverbed, on the meadow or at the water spill. They are made up of boulder, gravel, sand and mud. If they contain noble metals (gold and silver), they are called golden alluviums.
