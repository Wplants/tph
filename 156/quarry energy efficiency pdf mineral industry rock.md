##  Limestone and Crushed Rock - Energy
Limestone, one of the largest produced crushed rock, is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15 percent of the earth's sedimentary crust. This mineral is a basic building block of the construction industry and the chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime, and building stone are made. For the
