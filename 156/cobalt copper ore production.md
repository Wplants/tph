## Cobalt extraction
Recovery from copper-cobalt sulfide concentrates. The ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble sulfates and iron into insoluble hematite.The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte.Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step to maintain the acid balance

## Types of Deposits - Cobalt Institute
These deposits are primarily worked for copper with cobalt as a by-product. They account for over 50% of world cobalt mined production. Major deposits are characterized by ore minerals contained within organic-rich pyritic shales and sandstones deposited in a near-shore lagoonal environment, under reducing conditions.

Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal..

Current Mining Methods for Cobalt Production: Cobalt is found primarily with mineral deposits of nickel and copper in the Earth. There are many different cobalt ores that are mined, involving many steps of separation and purification. The most well-known and mined ores are: nickel cobalt sulfide, copper cobalt sulfide, copper cobalt oxide

Cobalt is present in many rocks, soils and sea water in very low concentration and exploitable deposits occur only in a few places. As a result cobalt-containing ores are not mined primarily for their cobalt content, but rather cobalt is produced as a by-product, particularly from the production of copper, nickel, silver, gold, lead, and zinc.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
