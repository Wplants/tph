## Relative Cost Metals | Zahner — Innovation and Collaboration to Achieve 
Dec 29, 2021For most metals, the fabrication and installation costs will be the same. So a metal like copper, which is two or three times more expensive than a steel sheet, might only be 2% more expensive when installed. This is the illusion of cost per square foot when discussing raw materials.

When only a single pair of gears is involved and the center distance can be varied, the best results will be obtained by making the non-metallic driving pinion of all-addendum form, and the driven metal gear with standard tooth proportions.
