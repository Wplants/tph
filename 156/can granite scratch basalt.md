## Granites and Basalts | Igneous Rocks | Geography
Characteristics of Basalts: . Basalt is a very fine-grained, dark coloured extrusive igneous rock which is formed due to cooling and solidification of molten lavas at the surface of the earth. Sometimes, the cooling of lavas takes place so rapidly that no time is available for the crystallization of basalt and hence no grains are formed, with the result the rock becomes glassy basalt.
