## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - StudiousGuy
Working Principle of a Jaw Crusher. A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces.
