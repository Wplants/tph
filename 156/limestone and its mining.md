Mining limestone begins with its extraction from viable deposits in mines and quarries, like the one present in the Lake Belt Region of western Miami-Dade County. There is no naturally formed rock anywhere in the world that demonstrates the versatility of limestone. Crushing or screening the rock only bolsters the multiplicity of applications.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.
