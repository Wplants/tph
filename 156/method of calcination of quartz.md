The main components of coal shale are kaolinite, quartz, illite and unburned coal.

##  Effect of Preparation Method and Calcination Temperature on LaCoO 
Preparation method and calcination temperature have great influence on the performance of the catalysts for most of the reactions. There have been studies reported on CO oxidation and other  compact fixed bed tubular quartz reactor. The reactor was consisting of two co-axial glass tubes of 20mm and 50mm diameter. A helical coil of quartz

3 days agoThe calcination for 2 h was enough to convert completely the quartz of FOSA into soluble materials. Also, it can be observed that calcite is the most stable thermodynamically under external conditions, which agrees with the literature . The patterns reveal that the calcite peaks at 2θ angles were about 25.4° to 29.3° at it directly
