A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.

Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h. Typically a mining haul truck will empty
