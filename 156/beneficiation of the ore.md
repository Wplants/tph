## Proposed beneficiation of low-grade iron ore evokes mixed reaction from 
Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.

## The Beneficiation Process of 80 Tons Per Hour Barite Ore in Hubei
May 4, 20217.4. Calculation of the total cost of barite beneficiation. The cost of selecting a ton of barite ore = (electricity fee + labor cost + loader cost) / 80 tons = (300 + 500 + 75) / 80 = 875/80 = 10.9375 RMB. It can be seen that the cost of using this process to sort barite ore is 10.9375 RMB per ton.
