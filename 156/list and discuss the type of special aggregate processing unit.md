The least lateral dimension of flaky aggregate (thickness) should be less than 0.6 times the mean dimension. Flaky Aggregates are not Elongated Aggregates (Its length should be 1.8 times its mean dimension). 4) Based on Unit Weight: Based on Unit weight, aggregates can be divided into three. They are Normal Weight, Heavy Weight and Light Weight.

## Concept of Aggregate Planning in Operations Management
INTRODUCTION. This unit deals with the concept of 'Aggregate Planning', which is an operational activity which does an aggregate plan for the production process, in advance of 3 to 18 months, to give an idea to management as to what quantity of materials and other resources are to be procured and when, so that the total cost of operations of the organisation is kept to the minimum over

## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.
