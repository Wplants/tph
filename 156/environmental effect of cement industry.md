Although cement production is a very energy-intensive industry which releases huge amounts of pollutants to the environment, there is a lack of environmental studies focused on applying CO 2 capture technologies to mitigate global warming in this industry. Furthermore, other environmental and human health impacts are omitted or underestimated.

## The Environmental Impacts of the Cement Manufacture Process
Concrete however, has two processes to production that has not changed from its inception. The wet and dry processes both require blasted raw material, a crushing and burning process to create the finished product. In an effort to help the environment, this report is done on the environmental impacts of concrete; from production to end of life.

## The Environmental Impact of Concrete/ Cement - Sawcutting Specialties
The concrete industry is not as harmful to the environment as it seems. In fact, concrete and construction industry leaders are hoping to take this one step further. They aim to do this by creating new cement mixtures. These mixtures would promote CO2 absorption and reduce emissions caused by the production process.

Nov 3, 2020The aggregates are sourced from a local body of water and crushed in a natural procedure. That process releases nearly no carbon emissions, the cement is the true problem when it comes to carbon footprint. The cement process is sole reason why the concrete industry makes up 8% of overall global emissions and 12% of emissions in New Jersey.

According to Chatham House, cement is the source of about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. To put that into perspective, if the cement industry was a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world. It contributes more CO2 than aviation fuel and isn't far behind the global agriculture business.

Yet producing the portland cement that binds concrete together is energy intensive and emits enormous amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) as well as numerous other pollutants. Fly ash can replace a percentage of portland cement in concrete, thus reducing the impacts of concrete while using a material that would otherwise be landfilled.
