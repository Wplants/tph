The off-cuts, trimmings and edgings from sawmills' green and dry sorters, are processed in a drum chipper. A significant portion of wood chips from sawmills are used as pulp chips, which demand a high quality. Bruks free-swinging chip screens are available in several sizes for separating up to four fractions.

## Coal Dust: How to Prevent a Power Plant Explosion
What causes a heat source in coal-fired power plants? The main cause of heat is friction. When a conveyor belt collects coal dust, it becomes a fire hazard. Coal dust only needs to accumulate to a footprint size and already it is a fire hazard. As the conveyor moves, any friction that occurs can be enough of a heat source to cause an explosion.

## Safeguarding the Hazards Presented by Conveyors
Most hazards associated with conveyors relate to the nip points, which can easily draw in clothing, tools, loose hair, fingers or limbs, depending on the size, speed and power of the conveyor. The standards, such as BS and BS EN 620, highlight where nip points typically exist, but be aware that reversible belt conveyors need nip points

## Underground safety of conveyor belts
UNDERGROUND SAFETY. Conveyor belts represent a high risk, because they have the ability to spread a fire over long distances. Fires on belt conveyors are mostly ignited by mechanical failures like frozen idlers, which is even more dangerous in combination with coal dust. The fire safety requirements are similar for the most hard coal mining

When working with pneumatic conveyors: Familiarize yourself with control devices and release valves to cut off air flow in the event of blockage. Shield joints and access points to prevent material from being thrown in the event of gasket failure. Ensure that screening is in place at the suction end to prevent large objects from being sucked in.

## Fire Fighting / Protection for Coal Conveyors?
I don't know what is used but maybe some logical thought will produce ideas. Coal is burning so -. 1) it gives off heat. 2) it gives off CO2. Maybe provide a thermal sensor (s) over the belt to detect burning, or maybe pass the carrying belt through a tunnel provided with CO2 sensors. These would monitor the coal for burning.
