## Using sound and wavelength to move rocks - The Harmonics of Nature
The relationship between C-sharp and F is a major 3rd. And from F at 5.4 Hz to C# is a major 3rd (x 5) of a major 3rd (A) (x 5) = 135 Hz x 2 = our C#. So, there you have it folks: the secret to moving masonry with sound is to create a resonance around infrasonic vibrations of our F frequency, with a harmonic of an augmented 5th at the same time

## The concept of specific energy in rock drilling - ScienceDirect
Since the process breaks rather than cuts solid rock into small fragments of assorted sizes it can be regarded as essentially one of crushing. As in crushing processes generally, energy/volume relationships are therefore of interest. 'Specific energy', defined as the energy required to excavate unit volume of rock, is a useful parameter in
