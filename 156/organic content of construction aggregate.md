## What Does Organic Matter Do In Soil? - Noble Research Institute
Organic matter causes soil to clump and form soil aggregates, which improves soil structure. With better soil structure, permeability (infiltration of water through the soil) improves, in turn improving the soil's ability to take up and hold water. Erosion Prevention. This property of organic matter is not widely known.

## Water for Construction
Water for Cement Concrete. Water for ordinary cement concrete mix should be equal to 5% by weight of aggregate and 30% by weight of cement. The actual quantity of water required to be added in the field depends on availability of aggregate and surface water present in the aggregate. It should be calculated by slump test.

## Expansivenbauverein-gleussen
Expansive soils, which have high contents of absorptive clay, can really put the squeeze on concrete foundation walls.These soils swell when they get wet, with increases in volume of 10% or more. That's enough pressure to crack concrete foundation walls and floor slabs and even cause foundation movement, resulting in damage to the upper floors of a home or building. 2021.
