## Limestone Mining - Michigan State University
One of the largest cement plant in the state is in Alpena. Crushed stone Most crushed stone is limestone and dolomite. It is used mostly for construction purposes, although much of it is also used in shoreline protection. In construction, crushed stone is used as an aggregate in concrete mixes. The stone binds the mix together when it hardens.

## High limestone content in cement: An important step towards decarbonisation
For example, the carbonation resistance of concrete with a cement with only 15 mass % limestone was equal to that of a cement with 30 or even 50 mass % limestone when the w/c ratio was reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3 (Figure 3). Of course, sophisticated process measures in cement plants are necessary for the production of high-limestone cements.

## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

Limestone is the most common form of calcium carbonate which is used extensively for the manufacture of cement. Cements in different types are made mainly by calcining a mixture of about 75% limestone and 25% clay to form a calcium silicate clinker which is then ground and mixed with a small amount of gypsum [5].

## Limestone As A Construction Material In Building Industry
Limestone today serves one key role which cannot go unmentioned. Limestone is the raw material in manufacture of cement. Cement is key in construction industry as it is used in various construction mixtures, to meet specific needs such as manufacture of composite concrete block, in holding building blocks in place over and above finishing such as flooring.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash. The cement might have a reduced water demand, and the coarser cement gradation
