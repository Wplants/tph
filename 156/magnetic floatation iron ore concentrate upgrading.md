## What Are Flotation Methods for Polymetallic Sulfide Ore II
2 days agoThe main minerals in gold-copper-iron polymetallic sulfide ore are magnetite and chalcopyrite. Natural gold occurs in chalcopyrite as fine particles. The combined flotation-magnetic separation process can effectively separate gold-copper and iron, and finally get gold-copper mixed concentrate and iron concentrate.

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Magnetic Floatation Iron Ore Concentrate Upgrading
Cationic Flotation Of Silica From Magnetic Ironâore. Strong collectors in other words tend to float small amounts of iron along with the silica Finely ground (90 less than 325 mesh or finer) magnetic concentrates with iron and silica almost completely liberated are highly responsive to upgrading Concentrates of the same fine mesh size but containing unliberated iron silicate are less responsive.

## Iron ore beneficiation technology by reverse flotation
Fast, easy to control and other advantages, which has been widely used in iron ore dressing plants. The reverse flotation process of iron ore is used in iron ore with complex iron mineral composition and high iron grade. It is mostly used to process coarse concentrates of gravity separation and magnetic separation to obtain high-grade iron ore.
