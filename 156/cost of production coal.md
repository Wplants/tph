## Prices and costs - Coal 2020 - Analysis - IEA
The average FOB price for Australian prime coking coal in 2019 was about USD 176/t, a y-o-y drop of roughly 15%. In comparison, supply costs for coking coal decreased only slightly, indicating that the profitability of met coal production decreased. The supply cost curve for both high and low calorific thermal coal decreased from 2018 to 2019.

Geography is also a factor when looking at relative fuel costs. While the national average share of electricity generated with coal has fallen, that share varies greatly by state.
