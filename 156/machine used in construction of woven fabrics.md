## Sewing 101: Seam Basics Part 1 (Woven Fabrics)
Plain Seam. The most basic of all seams, a plain seam is simply a straight stitch joining multiple pieces of fabric.Your fabric and project will determine the needle, stitch length, and tension setting on the sewing machine. For this example, we used Red Cotton Twill fabric.. You can use Universal (Regular Point) needles for woven fabrics.Their sharp point penetrates the fabric as it sews.

In woven fabrics, threads or yarns are placed perpendicular to one another, then attached together through a pattern called " warp " and " weft ". This creates fabric. Woven fabrics are produced on a loom. The loom joins two sets of yarns by weaving one set between the other. The two sets of yarns are perpendicular to each other.
