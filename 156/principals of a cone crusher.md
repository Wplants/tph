## What Is a Cone Crusher and What Can It Do for You?
Apr 24, 2020. A cone crusher is one of many different types of crushers, like impact crushers, jaw crushers, and hammermills, that is used to process and reduce material like aggregates and construction and demolition waste. The cone crusher distinguishes itself from these other crushers by how it operates in processing material.
