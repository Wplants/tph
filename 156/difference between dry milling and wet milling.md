## Which is better: dry or wet machining? | Cutting Tool Engineering
When near-dry milling with MQL, the tool's cutting edge works inside a mist formed from oil and compressed air, which is sprayed directly into the cutting zone. Depending on the design of a machine tool and milling cutter, the mist is delivered externally or internally through the cutter. The main function of MQL is to lubricate the cutting edge.
