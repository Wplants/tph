## Cement Grinding - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide. Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early.
