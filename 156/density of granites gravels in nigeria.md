Abstract This study investigates the engineering properties of concrete produced from gravels and also verify the suitability of local gravel aggregates obtained from Southwestern Nigeria in place of crushed granite. Preliminary investigations were carried out in five selected states (Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti) in Southwestern Nigeria to determine the registered gravel mining pits.
