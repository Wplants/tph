## High Grade Limestone
Limestone, quicklime and slaked lime are all used to neutralize excess acidity - which may be caused by acid rain - in lakes and in soils. Limestone is used as a building material, and to purify iron in blast furnaces. It's also used in the manufacture of glass, and of cement (one of the components of concrete).

## The Suitability Of Limestone Aggregates For Use In Structural Concrete
Limestone Aggregate in Asphaltic Concrete. Limestone aggregate is also generally suitable for use in Asphaltic Concrete and is economically feasible when the absorption is relatively low (Less than 2.5%). High absorption rates may result in added asphalt binder needed to allow for asphalt absorbed by the aggregate.
