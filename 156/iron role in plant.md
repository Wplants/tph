It's possible that an iron deficiency may just be the result of overwatering. If you're growing in soil, let the medium dry out, then flush it with slightly acidic water with a pH of 6.0-7.0.

This protein, called FRD3, plays a role in moving iron from the plant roots up into the leaves and other aerial portions of the plant. To help us better understand FRD3's role, we will determine what compounds the FRD3 protein transports and how the expression of the FRD3 gene and protein is controlled.

## Chelated Iron for Plants - What You Need to Know
The role of iron in plants is extremely important, because it helps in the function and development of chlorophyll, without which the leaves of the plant lose their healthy green color. Iron is also involved in nitrogen fixation, energy transfer, plant metabolism, and respiration. If the plant lacks iron, it will probably have problems.

The present review discusses iron toxicity in plants with regard to plant growth and metabolism, metal interaction, iron-acquisition mechanisms, biofortification of iron, plant-iron homeostasis, gene function in crop improvement, and micronutrient interactions. Iron is an essential micronutrient for almost all living organisms because of it plays critical role in metabolic processes such as

## Iron deficiency in plants | Haifa Group
Iron plays an important role in many plant functions, including chlorophyll development and function, energy transfer, nitrogen fixation, plant respiration and plant metabolism. Iron deficiency is more likely to happen in alkaline soils (pH>7.5, especially where calcium carbonate is abundant). Iron is immobile in plants and therefore deficiency

## Iron
Iron (/ ˈ aɪ ər n /) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.It is the fourth most common element in the
