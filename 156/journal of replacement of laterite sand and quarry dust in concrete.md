## The most dangerous type of soil for a trenching operation is
The types of soil found most often include: Loose soil is any type of soil that has been worked or disturbed so that it is not compacted. Sand is a granular soil. The shape of individual grains may be round or angular. Sandy soil tends to have large pores, allowing faster ground absorption.

##  Partial Replacement of Sand by Quarry Dust in Concrete - IJSRP
investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.

##  Study of Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregate by U Sing Quarry Dust
1. The compressive strength of concrete is i use of quarry dust up to 10% replacement of sand. F rom 10% there is decrease in compressive strength 2. The split tensile strength concrete is increased by the use of quarry dust up to 0% replacement of fine aggrega te. From 10% there is a decrease in split tensile strength. 3.
