## How the Construction Industry Can Better Use Recycled Building Materials
Oct 25, 2021Recycling building materials can pose challenges depending on the material. Fortunately, steel, glass and gypsum board are all highly recyclable. Almost all (98%) structural steel will avoid landfill, whereas around 70% of rebar used to reinforce concrete will be recycled. Careful separation can increase this efficiency.
