## Hematite
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t, ˈ h ɛ m ə-/), also spelled as haematite, is a common iron oxide compound with the formula, Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).With this it forms a

Mar 6, 2022Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

This solution of iron (II) ions required 26.4 mL of a

## the extraction process of hematite iron separation
synthesis and characterization of hematite (fe2o3) of iron contained in iron sand (86.73%). the results of xrd indicate the dominant primary phase in iron ore is hematite or fe 2 o 3, and in iron, sand is magnetite fe 3 o 4, before the extraction process, fe 2 o 3 was 58.009 m in size and after the process of extracting the particles was reduced to 20.950 m. while the fe 3 o 4 extraction of

## Phase transformations of stoichiometric mixtures of hematite and iron 
It was found that during the FAST process, iron reduces hematite to magnetite while oxidizing to wustite. With its nonstoichiometric structure wustite enables the nucleation of magnetite and at higher sintering temperatures, wustite and hematite transform to nearly pure stoichiometric magnetite with the formula Fe 2.982 O 4. The crystal unit
