## Raw material extraction and processing - rothe erde
Crushing plants are used in the production of broken minerals. When crushing the lumpy feed material, high demands are placed upon the machines. For this reason, heavy load bearings are used for crushing plants. thyssenkrupp rothe erde uses slewing bearings with the most diverse crushing capabilities in the crushing plant sector.

## crushing of raw material in cement process
Aug 26, 2019· (1) In the process of crushing cement production, most of the raw materials are crushed, such as limestone, clay, iron ore and coal. Limestone is the raw material for producing the largest amount of cement. After mining, the particle size is larger and the hardness is higher.

The cement industry processes requiring fine grinding are rawmix preparation, fuel preparation and grinding of clinker to make cement. All three may require a preliminary crushing stage. In the case of raw materials, attempts have always been made to minimise the amount of crushing needed by extracting the rock in the finest possible state.
