## Can you put bentonite in water?sewing
Bentonite beds are white or pale blue or green in fresh exposures, turning to a cream color and then yellow, red, or brown as the exposure is weathered further. As a swelling clay, bentonite has the ability to absorb large quantities of water, which increases its volume by up to a factor of eight.

## Bentonite clay — Cancer Survivors Network
The best healing clay is that which has not been processed (heated or bleached). The cleaning process removes many of the healing properties of the clay. You want raw, clean, natural swelling clay (one that expands when mixed with water). Natural calcium Bentonite clay has a high pH and an exceptionally strong adsorption and absorption ability.

## bentonite water absorption
Jan 26, 2019· Bentonite is an absorbent clay of volcanic origin. It is used for waterproofing purposes due to its ability to expand in contact with water. When bentonite and water touch, the clay expands its volume and turns into a gelatinous mass. As a matter of fact, bentonite can absorb 7 to 10 times its own weight in water.
