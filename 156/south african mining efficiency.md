## Mining & Mineral Processing - InvestSA
South Africa's mining industry is the fifth largest globally in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). The mining sector contributed R356bn or 7.3% to South Africa's GDP and accounted for 25% of the country's total export earnings. Platinum, coal and gold are the three largest mining exports. In 2018, the mining industry contributed R93bn

## Eskom's Role in South Africa's Electricity Generation and Efficiency
South Africa's energy production sector is fairly concentrated among a few actors. 85% of coal mining (~80% of SA's energy and 90% of its electricity production) is controlled by five companies. Electricity generation is even more concentrated. Though the state owned Eskom does not have exclusive rights, it does produce 95% of SA's

Mining in South Africa was once the main driving force behind the history and development of Africa's most advanced and richest economy. Large-scale and profitable mining started with the discovery of a diamond on the banks of the Orange River in 1867 by Erasmus Jacobs and the subsequent discovery and exploitation of the Kimberley pipes a few years later.
