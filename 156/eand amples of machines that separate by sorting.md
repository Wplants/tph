## Gravity-Powered Sorting Machine | STEM Activity - Science Buddies
When you need to separate things that are all mixed together, using a machine can be much faster than picking them apart by hand. In this project you will build a machine that can automatically separate two different size marbles, powered by nothing but gravity. This activity is not recommended for use as a science fair project.

## 31 Examples of Machines - Simplicable
31 Examples of Machines. A machine is a physical device that actively performs work. This can be contrasted with an entity that passively performs work such as a drainage pipe. A machine uses power but isn't necessarily electrical. For example, machines can be powered by wind, water, thermal, chemical or human power.
