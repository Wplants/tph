A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. [Rankine cycle] Coal is used as a fuel to heat water in a coal based thermal power plant.

## Electric Power Plant - Encyclopedia Information
A power station, also referred to as a power plant and sometimes generating station or generating plant, is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power.Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid. Many power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three-phase electric power.

## What is a Nuclear Power Plant : Working & Its Applications - ElProCus
The nuclear power plant diagram is shown below. Nuclear Power Plant Working Principle. In the power plant, the fission takes place in the reactor and the middle of the reactor is known as the core that includes uranium fuel, and this can be formed into pellets of ceramic.
