## Different types of ore should choose different crushers
Therefore, the user should select the crusher according to the type of material. For larger hardness ore, such as orthoclase, basalt, granite, iron ore, c series jaw crusher and jaw crusher PE can be used. The maximum crushing compressive strength of jaw crusher produced by Camelway can reach 320MPa, which is hard and bulky.
