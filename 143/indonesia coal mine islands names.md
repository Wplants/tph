At current rates of production, Indonesia's coal reserves are expected to last for over 80 years. In 2009 Indonesia was the world's second top coal exporter, sending coal to China, India, Japan, Italy and other countries. Kalimantan (Borneo) and South Sumatra are the centres of coal mining. In recent years, production in Indonesia has been

Since 2010, Indonesia has opened 22.7 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity, third in the world behind India and China. That means coal now accounts for nearly 60% of the country's electricity generation, a figure that has risen steadily since 2010. Production has also grown dramatically, from just 67 million tonnes (mt) in 2000, to 325

Feb 10, 2022In Indonesia, coal has long been exploited to satisfy the avarice of those in power. Prior to the country's independence, in 1861, the Dutch colonial government began mining coal in Palaran, East Kalimantan, before kicking off production in Ombilin, West Sumatra, in 1892. In fact, Kalimantan and Sumatra islands are Indonesia's 'supermarket' of coal. As of 2020, coal reserves on the two islands
