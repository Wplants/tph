## Strength and durability of concrete containing recycled concrete 
Recycled concrete aggregate was produced from concrete waste sourced from the demolition site of a water tank. The core strength of the original concrete was found to be 25 MPa. The concrete waste collected was subjected to primary crushing and screened to control the particle sizes of the recycled concrete aggregate.

## Review of Durability, Workability and Strength of Concrete by Replacing 
Because of increasing the use of natural sand as construction material, we need to focus on the use of alternate materials to protect the nature. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to emphasis the use of quarry dust and foundry sand in concrete as the placement of fine aggregate. Quarry dust and foundry sand are the waste by-products formed by stone crushing process and metal

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete properties and performance with respect to workability, durability

1.Size of fine aggregates: The largest size that falls under the limit of the exact set is 4.75 mm. Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.

## Evaluation of Strength Characteristics of Concrete Using Crushed Stone 
The test result indicates that crushed stone dust waste can be used effectively used to replace natural sand in concrete. In the experimental study of strength characteristics of concrete using crushed stone dust as fine aggregate it is found that there is increase in compressive strength, flexural strength and tensile strength of concrete.

## crushed stone dust as fine aggregate in concrete
 ensp 0183 ensp3 8″ gravel sometimes called quot Pea Gravel quot is a finer blend of crushed stone This aggregate is generally used for mixing with sand and cement to create concrete surfaces also walkways driveways and areas with poor drainage It is extremely popular in the landscaping appliions 3 8″ gravel can also be used to make precast concrete .
