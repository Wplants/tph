## The Complexities of Electrochemical Grinding - Metal Cutting Corporation
The Complexity Grows. Now we see that the electrochemical grinding process is really a combination of three things: surface grinding and chemistry and fixturing. And the three are unavoidably intertwined. There is no good reason to use an electrochemical grinding machine for its surface grinding aspect alone.

## Intro to Grinding Methods, Machines and Tools - Practical Machinist
Grinding is used to finish workpieces so that they meet the required surface finish quality. It rids unwanted material from the workpiece, like any rough texture that remains from previous machining applications. Grinding machines or tools use an abrasive wheel to remove metal from the workpiece. When the wheel rotates, it cuts material off the

## Grinding Machine-Parts, Functions, and Types
A grinding wheel and a regulating wheel are used to move the job. The grinder consists of four parts: work rest, regulating wheel, grinding wheel, and a guide. Because of the grinding wheel's pressure, Jobs keeps his hand on the work rest blade. The regulating wheel ensures that the job is spinning at the same speed.
