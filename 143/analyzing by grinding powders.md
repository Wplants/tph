## Effect of Moisture Content on the Grinding Process and Powder  - MDPI
Grinding is a staple size-reduction process to produce food powders in which the powdered form is chemically and microbiologically stable and convenient to use as end products or intermediate products. The moisture content of food materials before grinding is a particularly important factor, since it determines the materials' physical properties and the powder properties, such as flowability

Dry powders are used in a wide variety of industries including food, pharmaceuticals, refractories, and chemicals. It is estimated that 80% of materials used in industry are in a dry powdered form. A 'powder' is defined as fine dry particles produced by the grinding, crushing, or disintegration of a solid substance.
