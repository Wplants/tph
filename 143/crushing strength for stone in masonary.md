## Stone Masonry: Types, Advantages & Disadvantages
Disadvantages of stone masonry: Stone masonry is thick and heavy and reduces the floor space. This masonry has a high self-weight, low tensile strength, ductile strength, and seismic resistance. Stone masonry is time-consuming and requires skilled labor because it cannot be easily replaced, repaired, or moved.
