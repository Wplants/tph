## Bentonite: Applications With Coal as Bentonite-Clay - African Pegmatite
Mar 10, 2021Summary. Bentonite is a type of clay that is prized for its porosity, workability and non-toxic nature. In foundry applications, it is used with coal (bentonite-coal) in sand/green sand molding for metal castings; where it enhances the refractory properties of the mold whilst also increasing strength and flowability.

## Bentonite, Kaolin and Selected Clay Minerals (EHC 231, 2005)
1. SUMMARY 1.1 Identity, physical and chemical properties, and analytical methods . Bentonite is a rock formed of highly colloidal and plastic clays composed mainly of montmorillonite, a clay mineral of the smectite group, and is produced by in situ devitrification of volcanic ash. In addition to montmorillonite, bentonite may contain feldspar, cristobalite, and crystalline quartz.

Conclusively, since bentonite used was swelling clay, it increased the hydration rate of the mixes and reduced the setting time. Slump values for all mixes shows 1:3:6 mix has the lowest workability, followed by 1:2:4 mix and then 1:1.5:3 mix was the most workable except for 30% bentonite blend which deviated.

## Mixing Bentonite Drilling Fluid
When mixed in a vessel this size, use a full sack of bentonite to get a very thick mud. This mud will then be diluted when it is added to the mud pits. It takes at least 30 minutes of circulation through the mud pump to mix and fully hydrate a premium grade of bentonite. A lower grade of bentonite may take longer.

Methods. The materials used in the study including sand, coal ash and bentonite were mixed in varying proportions. The hydraulic conductivity of sand and coal ash was observed to be 1.75 × 10 −5 and 2.7 × 10 −6 m/s respectively. The percentage of bentonite added to different categories of mixes formulated were varied based on the proportion of the constituent materials added with
