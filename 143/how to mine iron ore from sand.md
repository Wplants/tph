## Console or Other Method - Seeing Ore - 7 Days to Die
I've had a ton of success mining ore. For everything but iron you should go to the edge of the specific biome and dig straight down to bedrock and then mine towards the middle of the biome. For iron, I use the sand patches on the surface and then dig that area to about 5-10 blocks below stone.

Getting iron ore is easy enough at the blast furnace. Do motherlode to 60, then mine iron in the mining guild. Motherlode is slower exp (especially before you unlock the upper level) but you get better drops and it's not nearly as click intensive. This is what I'm doing.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Iron is a medium tier material requiring the smeltery. If you smelt your ores in a smeltery it provides 2 ingots for every ore. Iron can also be used as a tool material. Molten Iron must be poured into casts to make parts via the smeltery. It is also used to make Pig Iron and Alumite.
