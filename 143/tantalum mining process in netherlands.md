## Global Tantalum Production, Conflict Minerals and The U. S. Dodd-Frank 
The production shift from Australia was a result of high extraction costs and an unfavorable exchange rate, which meant that mining tantalum ore in Australia was no longer economically viable. The shifting of tantalum production to the DRC, Rwanda and other African nations raised the concerns about tantalum's status as a conflict mineral.

Sources. Tantalum is chiefly obtained as a by-product of tin processing, although it is also mined from the minerals columbite, tantalite and samarskite. Other tantalum-bearing minerals include ferrotantalite, manganotantalite and microlite. Tantalum and niobium are almost always found together, and are recovered from pegmatite veins in granite

In the Western World, the Bayer 1 process, invented in the 19th century, is by far the most important process used in the production of alumi-num oxide from bauxite. The process has been refined and improved since its inception.

Mining is either open cut or underground and requires drilling and blasting. The broken rock then requires crushing and grinding to liberate the minerals prior to separation. In the process of comminution the liberated particles will generally not be rounded in shape but angular making their behavior in wet gravity separation more difficult.

The country produced 17% of the world's tantalum concentrates in 2014, nearly double the 9% it produced in 2000, but its society is fractured from decades of war. The government has historically had little control over the mining of minerals such as tantalum, and armed groups are constantly fighting for governance of mines and smuggling routes.

## Bald Hill Lithium and Tantalum Mine - Mining Technology
The Bald Hill lithium and tantalum mine falls within the Goldfields-Esperance region, approximately 105km south-east of Kalgoorlie. The project extends over 59,000ha and comprises four mining leases, eight prospecting licences, eight exploration licences, a general-purpose licence, a retention licence, and other miscellaneous licences.

## Tantalum from Rwanda Case Study - Hyperledger Foundation
Created by UK-based Circulor, the blockchain-based system to trace tantalum went live in three mines and an ore-sorting facility in Rwanda in fall 2018. "We're getting an awful lot of traceability for very little extra work," says Ray Power, CEO of Power Resources Group, which operates the mines. The system is designed to slash today's
