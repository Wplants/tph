## Types of Surface Mining | American Mine Services
In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

With this mining, the miner is engaged in an individual own equipment-based mining and all the mined coins including the transaction fees will be owned solely by the miner. This is ideal for relatively new cryptocurrencies. But that the equipment power is enough since a large hash rate is required to ensure the computational complexity.

Currently, there are a huge number of different types of cryptocurrency mining. The most common types of mining: On video cards (farms on GPU) On Asics (special equipment) Mining on the processor (CPU) Mining on hard drives (HDD/SSD) cloud mining; mobile mining; POS mining; We will talk about all types of mining in more detail later in the article.

## The Sensors Used in Mining Applications
Sensors are also used to prevent rock falls after operational measures have been put in place to keep the surrounding rocks in place. This is the case for both pit and underground mines where huge rock faces and exposed, potentially unstable rock faces/ceilings are present during the mining operation, respectively.
