## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
Taking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

## What is the crushing process? - MEKA
Crushing is the process of size reduction of ore. Size reduction process begins with usage of explosives at the area for production of ore. In later stages, the size reduction process performed with crushers before grinding in mills is called "crushing". Although there is no limit set, the downsizing process over 3 mm is considered as "crushing
