Figure 10: Locations of a few mining sites in South Africa during the Iron Age.  About 1300 years ago, holes and shafts were being dug to produce the ore. A lot of trees were required near the iron-ore deposits, as the smelting process required a lot of charcoal to provide enough heat. A supply of fresh water was also important.
