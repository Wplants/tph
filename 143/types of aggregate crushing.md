## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

## Aggregate Crushers - High-efficiency And Eco-friendly
Recycled sand and gravel aggregates have similar properties to natural sand and gravel, which can be sued to configure concrete or mortar or be used as raw materials for the production of bricks. Therefore, aggregate crushing machines are widely used in municipal engineering, housing construction, road paving, and other fields.

Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed. It is possible to crush stones of various sizes together in the machines. But in the case of hand-crushing, only similar-sized stones are used. Coarse aggregates are mixed in particular proportions to obtain high-quality concrete.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

In mines and quarries, conveying systems are inseparable from raw material blasting and mining, crushing processing, screening treatment to finished aggregate handling. Although there are many types of conveying equipment that can transport aggregates and ore, the most widely used in quarry and mineral processing applications is the belt conveyor.
