Manganese nodules. Manganese nodules are mineral bodies that are black-to-brown in colour, generally round with a diameter of one to 15 centimetres, and usually structured like an onion peel. They form primarily on the deep ocean floors covered by sediments (particle deposits) at water depths of 3500 to 6500 metres.
