## What is the crushing process? - MEKA
Crushing is the process of size reduction of ore. Size reduction process begins with usage of explosives at the area for production of ore. In later stages, the size reduction process performed with crushers before grinding in mills is called "crushing". Although there is no limit set, the downsizing process over 3 mm is considered as "crushing
