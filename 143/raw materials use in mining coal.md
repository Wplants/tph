Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Mining for Raw Materials - Reibus International
Mining for Raw Materials. In the process of making steel, mining is the very first step, as many of the materials required in the steelmaking process are naturally occurring minerals in the earth's crust. Mining is the process of obtaining these minerals using a pit or excavation in the earth. The mining process typically starts with finding

The primary source of this carbon is coking coal. Coal is a key raw material in steel production. Coal is primarily used as a solid fuel to produce electricity and heat through combustion. Coke, made by carburising coal (i.e. heating in the absence of oxygen at high temperatures), is the primary reducing agent of iron ore.
