## Barite beneficiation method and beneficiation process
The choice of barite beneficiation method is influenced by the type of ore, the nature of the ore, the size of the mine, and the use. The main mineral processing methods currently used are shown in the table. Generally, the residual ore is easy to be selected. Therefore, the re-election method is preferred; the sedimentary ore and the hydrothermal ore associated with sulfide ore, fluorite, etc

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

## Barite Beneficiation Description
Barite USGS. Barite is the mineralogical name for barium sulfate, which is also referred to as barytes. The most basic marketable product is known as crude barite, which is barite that usually has undergone simple beneficiation methods, such as jigging, tabling and washing, or more complex methods, such as flotation, heavy-media separation and magnetic separation.
