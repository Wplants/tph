1. How Heat Separates an Oil and Water Emulsion. When separating liquids from each other, heating to certain temperatures enhances separation. W hen the temperature of an oil and water emulsion is increased, the viscosity of oil is d ecreased. This lower viscosity allows the gas and water molecules to be more easily released. Heating oil emulsions also increases density between oil and water.

Filtration. Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material.Particle size can vary considerably, given the type of mixture. For instance, stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria, viruses, and protozoans.

To separate by density, learners can drop the beads into water - some beads will float and others will sink. To separate by size, learners can use the mesh and let the smaller beads fall through into the cup, with the larger ones staying behind. As an extension, include some beads which are identical in shape and size, but different colours.
