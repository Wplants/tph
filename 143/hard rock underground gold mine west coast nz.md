The discovery and development of gold-bearing quartz veins near Reefton around 1870 marked a shift from alluvial to hard-rock mining. Unique names are a remnant of the coast's hard-rock mining days. Crushington lies south-east of Reefton, and was where quartz-crushers worked day and night extracting gold from the Globe mine.

This theme brings together a group of gold mining sites that began with the small Coromandel rush of 1852, followed by another small rush in 1857 at Aorere in Golden Bay. Then came the big Otago rush of 1861 and ended when Waiuta closed in 1953. The principal New Zealand goldfields were Coromandel, Nelson/Marlborough, Central Otago and West Coast.
