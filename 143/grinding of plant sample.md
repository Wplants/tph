However, for some samples a judgment must be made on the benefit gained from grinding. Normally, all samples must be dry or have been dried to less than 12% moisture. In special cases, a freeze grinding procedure using dry ice may be used for samples that must be ground wet. The laboratory is equipped with 4 grinding mills.

## Influences of sample storage and grinding on the extraction of soil 
Moreover, grinding improved the extraction efficiency of amino sugars for the dried soils. Due to the reduced extraction concentration in dried soils, field-moist samples were recommended in priority. For the dried soils used for the long-term storage, grinding can be an option to improve the extraction efficiency.
