## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

Copper recovery decreased above a pulp temperature of 35° C. The optimum temperature for high copper and low gangue flotation was 30° C. The natural pulp pH for the cement copper sample used in this series of flotation tests was 5.8. Lower pH's were obtained by adding H2SO4 to the pulp and higher pH's by adding CaO.

Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form. This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC.  Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then

4. Beneficiation of Copper Ore. The next step in processing is called beneficiation. This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form. 5. Smelting and Extraction. The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution. 6.

The non-flammable type is a concern with copper. Many contain Carbomide (aka: Urea) which is an ammonia compound. Most likely it causes corrosion of copper creating copper carbonate. Ammonia also reacts with zinc in brass. The flammable types contain all petroleum compounds and don't affect copper.
