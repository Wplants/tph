## How waste coal Is fueling Bitcoin in Pennsylvania
Waste coal is less cost-effective than conventional coal plants, and the reason we have waste coal plants at all is that Pennsylvania ratepayers and taxpayers heavily subsidize them. We give a tax credit to plants for every ton of waste coal that they burn. Right now, they're also getting what are known as Tier II alternative energy credits.

Its dual-use design allows it to use up to 91% of the energy content in the bituminous coals it burns. The Isogo thermal power station near Yokohama, Japan houses two coal-fired units. Unit 2 operates at 600°/620°C reheat, achieving 45% efficiency while Unit 1 operates at a slightly lower temperature. Combined, the facilities emit 50% less

Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant. The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity. The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal. All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process. Before going into the details, let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.
