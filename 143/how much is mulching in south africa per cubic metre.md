## Mulch Calculator
Multiply your square footage by your depth. 31.5 sq ft × 0.25 ft = 7.875 cubic feet. You need mulch for 5 beds, so 5 × 7.875 = 39.375 cubic feet. The Mulch Calculator makes this calculation easy by doing all the conversions and the math for you. You can also input how much your mulch will cost by the unit, like per cubic yard or cubic meter
