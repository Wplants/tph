## Mineral resources
Surface mining can make use of any of the following three types: (a) Open-pit mining in which machines dig holes and remove the ores (e.g. copper, iron, gravel, limestone, sandstone, marble, granite). (b) Dredging in which chained buckets and draglines are used which scrap up the minerals from under-water mineral deposits.

## Mineral Resources: Examples, Types, Uses and Exploration
Mineral resources are useful and natural materials for making valuable goods; these resources play an important role in our economic sector, majority of the countries in the world solely depend on mineral resources for their economic growth and development. Minerals are refined into finished goods for making most of the industrial products which we use in our society such as railways, roads

A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that cannot be replaced as quickly as it is being used. Examples of non-renewable resources include minerals and ores, oil, natural gas and coal. Renewable natural resources replenish over a short amount of time and include timber and energy from wind, solar and waves.
