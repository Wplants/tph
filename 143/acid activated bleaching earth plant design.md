Bleaching clays normally contain 10-18% moisture. If the clay is completely dried prior to use, its structure collapses, causing reduction in the bleaching power because of decreased surface area. In addition to these, adsorptive capacity of acid activated clay is reduced if clay is added to hot oil.

Acid-activated clays also are of bentonitic origin. The basic raw clay, however, is of a type that has a very low natural activity but is highly activable by treatment with mineral acid. Commercial acid-activated clays generally possess several times the decolorizing power (bleaching efficiency) of the best quality of fuller's earth. The former
