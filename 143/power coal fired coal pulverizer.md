Pulverizer housing or burner lines are glowing red. Mill fires require immediate attention to prevent damage to the pulverizer and more damaging mill "puffs". Explosions in a pulverized coal system are normally called "puffs.". A mill puff is an explosion in the mill system caused by an explosive combination of coal, air and temperature.
