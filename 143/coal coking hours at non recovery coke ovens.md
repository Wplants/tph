## Effect of Indian Medium Coking Coal on Coke Quality in Non-recovery 
The maximum possibility of utilizing the Indian coking coals and inferior grade coking coal for producing metalurgical coke through non Grecovery stamp charging technology was investigated. Indian indigenous coals contained low percent of vitrinite (<50%) and higher content of ash (> 15%) compared to imported coking coal. Therefore, the selection of appropriate proportion of diferent types of

## How to Create Coke in a Coal Pilot Plant or Testing Oven
On a small testing scale, coke can be formed by the slow heating of coking coal in a refractory lined coal testing oven (CTO) to 1000 ËšC for 3 to 4 hours without the presence of air. The coal softens at a temperature of between 400 and 500 ËšC to form a plastic or liquid phase, agglomerates, swells and particles fuse.

In order to produce coke that will be used in blast furnaces, coal is usually thermally distilled for 15 to 18 hours, but the process can take up to 36 hours. The temperature of the ovens ranges between 900 and 1100 degrees Celsius (1,650 and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit).

The coking process is based on the transformation of coal into coke at high temperature. In non-recovery coke oven, heating is usually asymmetric, this may be due to the fact that heating is provided by controlled combustion of volatile matter of charged cake at oven crown and sole flue.In the present investigation, a simplified temperature profiles were simulated to typical temperature

## Non-Recovery Coke Oven - CarbonoTech
Non Recovery Coke Oven. In Non-Recovery coke plants, the metallurgical coal is carbonized in horizontal oven chambers at high temperature & at negative oven pressure. The carbonization method takes place inside the oven from the top by radiation and from the bottom through the sole floor by conduction of heat.
