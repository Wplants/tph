## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
A Jaw crusher is made use of for the function of primary squashing. Hence the rocks fed as input are of plus size. It is able to squash material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is utilized for second crushing. The input to the cone crusher is a lot smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
