Sep 14, 2020Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

## What Is Crushed Concrete Aggregate and What Is It Used For?
Crushed concrete aggregates are pieces of old concrete buildings, roads, and other destroyed concrete structures that are crushed in a crushing machine. This crushed material is then washed clean, then broken up into smaller fragments. The fragments are added to other materials, including virgin concrete, to create recycled aggregate.
