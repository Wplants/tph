## Recovery of Silver and Gold from Copper Anode Slimes
Copper anode slimes, produced from copper electrolytic refining, are important industrial by-products containing several valuable metals, particularly silver and gold. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the extraction processes for recovering silver and gold from conventional copper anode slimes. Existing processes, namely pyrometallurgical processes

## Make GOLD from Copper, Silver & Plant Extracts
Apr 11, 2022Is he asking how to make 10 or 14 or 18 K gold from 24K gold, or is he asking how to extract pure gold out of an alloy, or is it a dream of making 10K gold into 24K gold by alchemy. The last one would be either foolish or a scam.  Take 65% gold, 20% copper, 15% silver, heat and cool continuously for 90 days, the entire thing will become gold
