Aggregate commonly is classified into two categories: fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Fine aggregate is the materials that could pass the No.4 sieve, and most could be remained on a No. 200 sieve.  while the other parts will be returned to impact crusher, thus forming a closed circuit. Size of final products can be combined and graded

## Open or Closed Circuit Crushing - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Closed Circuit Reduction-Stage Capacities. Thus far we have considered open-circuit crushing through the several reductions in a multi-stage crushing plant. Very rarely are we able to turn out a finished product without closing the flow-line circuit somewhere along the line. Without going into any argument for or against closed-circuit crushing
