## Open or Closed Circuit Crushing - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Closed Circuit Reduction-Stage Capacities. Thus far we have considered open-circuit crushing through the several reductions in a multi-stage crushing plant. Very rarely are we able to turn out a finished product without closing the flow-line circuit somewhere along the line. Without going into any argument for or against closed-circuit crushing
