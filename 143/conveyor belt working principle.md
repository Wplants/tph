## Conveyor belt
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt

May 17, 2021A conveyor at 30 degrees has a cosine = 0.866. Therefore, a weight of 40 pounds on the conveyor would result in a measured force of 34.64 lbs on the scale. A fixed angle conveyor scale can be compensated by a change of gain in the scale. In the above example, 34.64 lbs/cos. (30)=40 pounds.
