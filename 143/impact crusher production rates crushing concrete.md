"Also, you want to choke feed the crusher to get maximum production rates and a 360-degree crush." Don't trickle feed the crusher; that will lead to uneven component wear, more irregular product sizes and less production. An inexperienced operator will often reduce the feed rate rather than to simply open the close side setting.

## Impact Crushers | Weir
What is an Impact Crusher? Compared to the compression style of crushing, impact crushing crushes rocks at high-speed with a rotor that hits and throws the rocks into the curtain or apron which further reduces particle size.. Given that the inserted rotors (VSI and HSI) operate at high speeds, impact crushers are best suited to materials with a low work index (low hardness), low silica levels
