So, when a smelting furnace is opened, the iron should have melted out of the iron ore and formed what is called a bloom. This is just a mass of iron; porous and usually with slag around the outside.

Â· Primary Steel Making. Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore, coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace. The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4-4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle. So we need to move to further process the steel to achieve the desired.

For ore, the ideal size ranges between 'pea to rice' size - 5 to 2 mm, but retaining the 'dust'. Ore too fine may simply blow back out of the furnace, and tends to absorb excess carbon. Too large and the particles will not completely reduce to metallic iron. Some ore types should be roasted before breaking and adding to the furnace.

## Recycling is the primary energy efficiency technology for aluminum and 
Primary production of steel usually involves using a blast furnace to produce molten iron from iron ore, coal, and coke, using fluxing agents such as limestone to remove impurities. The molten iron (pig iron) is then converted into steel by a BOF. Secondary production facilities typically use an EAF, with scrap providing the main input.

## NPS Historical Handbook: Hopewell Furnace
Most of the Hopewell Furnace ores came from the Jones', St. Mary's, and Hopewell Mines, not far from the Village. Only a very few attempts were made at shaft mining before the Revolutionary War. Three or four good miners could generally supply all the ore needed for a single furnace. Charcoal was the fuel used to smelt iron ore in America
