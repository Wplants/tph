## Calculating the Weight of Stone - National Park Service
Sep 27, 2021For example: If the stone you are working with is granite that is approximately .64ft3 your calculation should look like the following; ft3 x lbs/ft3 = lbs so your calculation would be; minimum lbs= .64 x 159 = 101.8, maximum lbs = .64 x 180 = 115.1 Therefore the granite is between 101.8 and 115.1 pounds. The weight is given in a range because not all stones of the same type weigh the same.

Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.
