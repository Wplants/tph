## Calculating the Weight of Stone - National Park Service
Sep 27, 2021For example: If the stone you are working with is granite that is approximately .64ft3 your calculation should look like the following; ft3 x lbs/ft3 = lbs so your calculation would be; minimum lbs= .64 x 159 = 101.8, maximum lbs = .64 x 180 = 115.1 Therefore the granite is between 101.8 and 115.1 pounds. The weight is given in a range because not all stones of the same type weigh the same.
