## Landfilling Construction Waste in Australia - Architecture 
The Value of Green Star (GBCA 2013) stated that our Australian standard recycling practice was still sending 42 per cent of a typical commercial construction project's waste to landfill, only managing to recycle 58 per cent. We now use commingled construction skips that can achieve a 60 to 80-plus per cent recycling rate on our projects.
