## Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Reduction of High-Chromium-Containing 
Coal is an abundant resource which can be used to produce low-cost energy; however, its usage causes great environmental damage. Before mineral coal can be used, it must be processed to remove coal tailings. These tailings contain pyrite and accumulate in large dumps, presenting significant environmental liabilities, such as acid mine drainage. Another industry that generates environmental

## Aquatic Macrophytes for the Removal of Heavy Metals from Coal Mining 
Coal is the most important fuel used for generating electricity worldwide; however, the process of coal mining involves the release of huge amount of effluent into the surface water. Effluent from coal mine contains high load of TSS, TDS, calcium carbonate and heavy metals, hence contaminates the aquatic regime [ 1, 2, 36, 37 ].

In addition to mining coal, this could include mining oil or a number of precious stones and metals. Surface mining is a process that requires the equipment to be able to move large volumes of earth materials and rocks from one location to another location.
