## Advantages And Disadvantages Of Surface Mining | ipl
Selective mining is the other pros that Surface Miners has, it decreases the dilution of ore and increases the yield of handle and preparation plant. High production rate is the third advantage of surfaces miners and it is already experienced in New Acland Coal mine. Less health, safety and environmental impacts caused by surface miners.

What are the advantages of using surface miners for hard rock deposits such as iron ore when compared to alternative mining methods? Surface excavation machines (SEMs), like the Vermeer Terrain Leveler ® SEM, use top-down cutting that allows the operator to separate materials, extract higher value and more consistent sized product. The end product reduces the need for a primary crusher
