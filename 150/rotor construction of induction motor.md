Design of Rotor: There are two types of rotor construction. One is the squirrel cage rotor and the other is the slip ring rotor. Most of the induction motor are squirrel cage type. These are having the advantage of rugged and simple in construction and comparatively cheaper. However they have the disadvantage of lower starting torque.

## Induction Motor: Construction, Working principle & Advantages
It is because of the low cost, simple and rugged construction of the motor. Moreover, it has good operating characteristics with an efficiency as high as 90%. An induction motor does not have any commutator, like the one we saw in a DC motor. Hence it provides a good speed regulation without any sparking.

## Slip ring Induction Motors - Electrorules
Jun 21, 2022Rotor Construction of Induction motor . The rotor of the slip ring induction motor is also cylindrical or constructed of lamination. Squirrel cage motors have a rotor with short-circuited bars whereas slip ring motors have wound rotors having "three windings" each connected in star. The winding is made of copper wire.
