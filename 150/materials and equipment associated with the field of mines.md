## Demining: What's Demining and What Equipment is there?
Demining is the name given to the process of mine clearance, which also generally covers more than just land mines. Other unexploded ordnance, devices and ammunition will still need to be carefully removed from an area of land to make it safe for use. The process of demining and land clearance is left to experienced experts, which is carried

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

When companies break up materials during mining, the dust can release a variety of heavy metals commonly associated with health problems. As dust, these minerals (such as the asbestos-like mineral riebeckite) can be absorbed into lung tissue, causing problems like pneumoconiosis and silicosis, commonly known as Black Lung (Paul & Campbell, 2011).

Open pit mining is usually found where coal seams are thick and can reach depths of hundreds of feet. Equipment used in surface mines include draglines, shovels, bulldozers, front-end loaders, bucket wheel excavators and trucks. In large mines, draglines remove the overburden while shovels are used to load the coal.
