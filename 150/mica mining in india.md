## INDIA : CHILD LABOUR IN MICA PRODUCTS - Terre des Hommes
The world's largest source area of the mineral mica is the Indian region Jharkhand / Bihar. Only 10% of the mica from this area originates from legal mines with strict supervision of working conditions. The other 90% comes from illegal mines where an estimated twenty thousand children work, often with their entire family.

## The Dark Secret Behind Mica Mining
The Dangers of Illegal Mica Mining . In an effort to limit deforestation, India enacted a forest law in 1980. In 20 years, mica mining came to a halt. Unfortunately, demand for natural mica didn't stop and closed mines have been taken up by contractors who send locals scavenging the precious sheets.
