## macraes processing plant
Processing Gold at Macraes is known as 'refractory ore', which means it is ultra-fine and resistant to the typical cyanide leach process, typical of most gold processing plants. This refractory nature of the ore led to inefficiencies recovering the gold from ore in the past.
