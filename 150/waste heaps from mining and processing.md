Jul 29, 2022Radiation Facts. Regardless of how uranium is removed from rock, the extraction process creates radioactive wastes. If not managed properly, mining waste and mill tailings can contaminate the environment. Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that has been mined and used for its chemical properties for more than a thousand years.

## UG-Mat Mineral Processing Wastes | Recycled Materials Resource Center
Mineral processing wastes are referred to in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as wastes that are generated during the extraction and beneficiation of ores and minerals. These wastes can be subdivided into a number of categories: waste rock, mill tailings, coal refuse, wash slimes, and spent oil shale.

## waste heaps from the mining and processing
Waste heaps left by historical ZnPb ore mining are . The heaps are scattered over vast areas of beech forests in southern Poland Three types of study plots were established: (1) on waste heaps themselves, (2) in their vicinity (510m from the foot of the heaps, with no waste rock but potentially influenced by the heaps through drainage water), and (3) at least 100m from the foot of the heaps
