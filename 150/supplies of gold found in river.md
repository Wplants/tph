## Finding Gold in a River - Gold Fever Prospecting
Gold is found in lode deposits, residual deposits, alluvial deposits, bench deposits, streambed deposits, ancient rivers, and flood layers. A lode deposit is a crack or fissure in hardrock that's full of gold. This is the original source of placer deposits. Residual deposits are pieces of ore that have eroded away from a lode.

## » Prospecting for Gold in Hard-packed Streambeds
Successful mining in streambeds is generally accomplished in two steps: (1) prospecting and (2) production. This is true on any scale of operation. First, you need to find a gold deposit, usually a pay-streak. Once the deposit is located, then you can concentrate on a production program to recover the gold from the deposit.

## How and Where to find Gold in a River | MetalDetector
This means that most of the natural resources, like gold in a river will be found near the bottom, where the water is slower-moving. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. If there has been a recent storm or flood, for example, gold might be spread throughout the riverbed or even washed up on its banks.

## Digging for Gold in Ancient Tertiary Rivers
Some of the highest concentrations of gold are found in ancient Tertiary gravel deposits. These are locations where a river once flowed millions of years ago, but is now located far from the existing river. The process of erosion essentially leaves the old river channel "high and dry," stranding the gold far away from the existing river.
