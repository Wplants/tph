## What is Coarse Aggregates? Types, Classification, Characteristics 
Oct 2, 2021The Aggregates which will get retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve and will pass through a 3-inch sieve are known as Coarse aggregate. The aggregates used in the production of concrete are inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, and recycled concrete. The aggregates might be natural, manufactured, or recycled.
