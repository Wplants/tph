Impact crushers provide better grain-size distribution of RA for road construction purposes, and they are less sensitive to material that cannot be crushed, such as steel reinforcement. Generally, jaw and impact crushers exhibit a large reduction factor, defined as the ratio of the particle size of the input to that of the output material.

Figure Schematic diagram of a crusher showingg the open- and closed-side settings. Jaw and Gyratory Crushers. Jaw and gyratory crushers are used mostly for primary crushing. They are characterized by wide gape and narrow discharge and are designed to handle large quantities of material. The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size
