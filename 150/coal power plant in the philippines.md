## Philippines: Coal remains top fuel source of PH power plants
Dec 4, 2020The Philippines remains heavily reliant on coal, with the fossil fuel powering 54 percent of the total electricity output even during the coronavirus pandemic, data from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) show.  Natural gas-fired power plants were a far second with 3,295 MW or 16 percent of total. In terms of electricity that was

## Philippines declares moratorium on new coal power plants
Oct 28, 2020The Philippines rely on a particularly inflexible energy grid which is heavily dependent on large coal plants to provide baseload power - making it difficult and expensive to take coal plants offline to adjust to changing demand. This has led to regular power outages and increasing disruptions in the energy sector.

## Coal fired power plant - Energy Education
Coal fired power plants also known as coal fired power stations are facilities that burn coal to make steam in order to generate electricity. These stations, seen in Figure 1, provide ~40% of the world's electricity. [2] Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70-75% of their

## The Philippines considers a power sector future without new coal
Coal-fired power prices have previously ranged from PHP 3.5 to PHP 7.11 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Negative effects on the trade balance: The Philippines imported an estimated 29.4 million tonnes of coal in 2019 at a cost of US$ 2.3 billion, representing 7 per cent of the nation's yearly trade deficit. This is triple the tonnage imported in 2011.
