Different Types Of Concrete includes Strengths amp Grading. Concrete strength is measured by the weight it can withstand 28 days after it has been laid and cured. our concrete strengths range from grade c10 to c40. c10, with a strength of 8 newtons, is designed for kerb backing and bedding. c40, our strongest concrete with a strength of 40 newtons, is designed to withstand heavy-duty.
