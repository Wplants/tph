## Effect of alumina occurrence on sintering performance of iron ores and 
May 1, 20211. Introduction. With the continuous huge demand for steel in China and increasing consumption of high-quality iron ores worldwide, low grade iron ores have been imported in enormous quantities by China, specially alumina-rich iron ores [,,, ].Thus, iron ore sinter as the major burden for blast furnace production is achieving an obvious increase in Al 2 O 3 content accordingly [4,5].

## Effect of alumina and its types on sintering performance - AusIMM
With the rapid expansion of the Chinese steel industry and exhaustion of choice iron ore deposits, high-grade iron ore resources are in short supply globally. More and more mid-low grade iron ores with high Al2O3 content has been exploited and imported from oversea in China. Undoubtedly, the undesired Al2O3 content in iron ores certainly have an adverse impact on subsequent sintering process.

Considerable emphasis has therefore been placed on the chemical composition and consistency of iron ore fines, particularly in terms of alumina content. However, due to the limited reserves and increasing depletion of high-grade iron ore resources, the alumina content of iron ores is expected to increase gradually.

Of all the samples, lateritic ore analysed highest alumina of 6.87% followed by soft laminated and mineable transitional ore (4.5%). Alumina is lower than 2.5% in friable ore as well as blue dust. The yields of +10/8 mm lumps from dry screening of composite ore were in the range of 48.3-55.8% and analysed about 4.0% A1203.

As one of the most common constituent of gangue in iron ore, it has been known that alumina plays an important role in the formation of silico ferrite of calcium aluminum (SFCA), which are derivatives of calcium ferrites. SFCA is the most desirable bonding phase in iron ore sinter due to its high reducibility and mechanical strength.

## Processing of high alumina iron ore slimes using classification and 
High alumina iron ore slimes from Joda, India are processed using classification with hydrocyclone and flotation. Slimes are characterized using QEMSCAN, SEM and XRD. The effect of hydrocyclone design variables on grade and recovery is investigated. Flotation of hydrocyclone underflow using amines and fatty acid as collector is studied.
