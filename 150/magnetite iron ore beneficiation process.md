The high content product of obtained materials is iron ore concentrate, and the rest one is flotation tailings. This magnetite beneficiation process is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore, especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
Aug 12, 2022Beneficiation by magnetic elimination of iron is practiced on a limited scale, primarily on ore consumed in abrasive and refractory industries. The bauxite is usually dried or calcined before magnetic separation because the heating converts siderite (FeCO 3 ) to magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), leaves pyrite (FeS 2 ) as a magnetic residue, and makes

## Beneficiation of low-grade, goethite-rich iron ore using microwave 
Jun 1, 2021Microwave-assisted magnetizing roasts were used to produce an iron ore product from low-grade, goethite-dominant, iron ore plant rejects. Goethite was found to be converted to hematite at temperatures above 370 °C on reduction in a microwave furnace under gas mixtures of 30:70 and 40:60 CO/CO 2. Reduction to magnetite occurred at higher
