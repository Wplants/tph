## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Quarrying. Most of the raw materials used are extracted from the earth through mining and quarrying and can be divided into the following groups: lime (calcareous), silica (siliceous), alumina (argillaceous), and iron (ferriferous). Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated

## Quarries - HSE
Crystalline silica is one of the commonest minerals in the earths crust and forms a proportion of the many materials extracted from quarries. When crushed or abraded during quarrying activities, materials containing silica create respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust. It is this respirable dust that is associated with the respiratory disease

## Temporal Changes of Solid Waste at Limestone Quarries in and Around 
The inappropriate or unsafe management of solid rock wastes at quarry working continues to create opposition from local communities and the general public and has contributed to the negative impact on public perception of the mining industry. It can be better monitored by the remote sensing satellite data than the underground mining.

In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

## Is quarrying good or bad?rsandscience
Although some quarries do not produce a large amount of waste, others produce significant waste materials that damage the environment. The wastes can damage water bodies around the area, causing water contamination, whereas the large amounts of solids exacerbate flooding when dumped on flood plains.

## Why do quarries fill with water?sewing
Are quarries safe? Quarries are extremely dangerous places to swim. Steep drop-offs, deep water, sharp rocks, flooded equipment, submerged wire, and industrial waste make swimming risky. Another risk factor is the very cold water.  Jumping or falling into cold water can be fatal - even for a young healthy person.

## Why do we need to stop quarrying?
Score: 4.6/5 (22 votes) . Mining and quarrying can be very destructive to the environment.They have a direct impact on the countryside by leaving pits and heaps of waste material. The extraction processes can also contaminate air and water with sulfur dioxide and other pollutants, putting wildlife and local populations at risk.
