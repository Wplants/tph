Just convert that sq.ft into Sqm using Google Instant Area Conversion Tool and then use this formula.

## How to calculate quantity of cement mortar in brickwork and plaster
Jun 6, 2022Aug 08, 2020 · Now we calculate the volume of materials used in cement mortar based on its proportions. Let's say, the proportion of cement and sand in mortar is 1:X, where X is the volume of sand required. Then, the volume of sand required for 1:X proportion of 1m 3 cement mortar will be 1.6 x X / 1+X. 3. Volume of cement will be calculated as: 1 x 1.6 / 1+X..

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand Quantity for Plastering?
To convert into cement bags - (0.581 x 1440)/50 = 16.7 Bags. Unit weigh of Cement - 1440 Kg/m3 1 bag cement - 50 Kg. Required Sand Volume = 3/4 x 1.55 (Bulkage & Wastage) x Mortar Volume. = 3/4 x 1.55 x 1.5 = 1.74 m3. So the required quantity of material for 100 sqm plastering with mortar thickness 15mm & mix ratio 1:3 is.
