## 'New Naughton' plant aims to convert coal to ammonia - Kemmerer Gazette
Jun 8, 2022Coeny said that the project has three main activities: coal gasification, electricity generation and ammonia production. The project will convert coal into carbon-free power and ammonia. Ammonia can be used as carbon-free fuel in existing coal powerplants, and those plants can eventually be transitioned to be totally ammonia fueled, Coeny said.

Gas production was coal-based synthesis until 1950. By the growth of cheap feeds and the new process of vaporization and partial oxidation, a new era began in the ammonia industry. At first, this development began in United States and the reforging of natural gas or water vapor was applied to produce synthesized gas.

Initial works on the use of ammonia for powering applications goes back to Victorian times, when a small train was designed by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney to compete with coal-based steam trains. Unfortunately, the still inefficient engines, the un-tackled smell and the reluctance from a very profitable coal industry led Sir Gurney to abandon his
