## » Dry-washing for Gold
There is also an enormous amount of gold-bearing mountainous dry placer ground which has remained relatively untouched by large-scale gold mining activity because of the scarcity of water required in those locations to support wet recovery methods. Generally speaking, dry methods of gold recovery are not as effective or as fast as wet recovery

Unlike many gold-bearing areas of the west that were discovered during the mid to late 1800's, the Rye Patch placers were not discovered until 1938.  The limited ground cover also makes detecting easy, as the grass and desert shrubs are easy to work around when compared to many other mining areas in rougher terrain. The gold also occurs in

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

Perform a simple test of the material in the pan to assess whether it is real gold. Raw gold appears brassy yellow and bright. If you think it is gold, place your hand between it and the sun to create shade over the gold. If it still appears bright in the pan, chances are that it is real gold. Fool's gold does not appear as bright when shaded.
