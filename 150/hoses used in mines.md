What's most interesting about them is that they were first used for pulling carts, plowing farmland and carrying peat, or coal due to their ability to pull twice their own weight, unlike other draft horses which can only pull approximately half their own weight. The Industrial Revolution in the mid-19 th century increased the need for coal.
