## Dolomite: A sedimentary rock known as dolostone or dolomite rock - Geology
Dolomite, also known as " dolostone " and " dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite and limestone are very similar

## Limestone: Characteristics, Uses And Problem | GSA
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed principally of calcium carbonate (calcite) or the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite).  The liquid containing the coloration may be absorbed into the stone and during the normal process of evaporation, the coloring pigment is deposited in the stone.

Limestone origins. Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of more than 50% calcium carbonate. Although it occurs in many different forms, its origins can be traced back to either chemical or biochemical processes that occurred in the geological past, often tens to hundreds of millions of years ago.
