## antimony ore flotation process production line
Antimony Wikipedia. Production process. The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation, while higher-grade ores are heated to 500600 °C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the gangue minerals.

## antimony production process
The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields: blast furnaces produce hard lead (10% antimony) while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produced semisoft lead (3-4% antimony).Read more

Antimony has become an increasingly critical element in recent years, due to a surge in industrial demand and the Chinese domination of primary production. Antimony is produced from stibnite ore (Sb2O3) which is processed into antimony metal and antimony oxide (Sb2O3). The industrial importance of antimony is mainly derived from its use as flame retardant in plastics, coatings, and electronics

Jan 14, 2021Antimony ore can be divided into antimonite, cubismite, antimony ochre, etc. Due to the difference in the nature of the ore, the process used is also different. Commonly used beneficiation processes include manual separation, gravity separation and flotation .  If the particle size of the antimony ore is too small, the production capacity
