## ARTICLE: Local cement industry is suffering
Mar 26, 2021The cement Industry is arguably one of the largest contributors to the country's GDP. For this reason, it is imperative for government/stakeholders to support the sector with policies and stringent measures put in place to safeguard it from collapse.  the impact on cement price among other raw materials will be obviously positive. The market

## Is coal a raw material for cement? - Origin of coal
Why coal is used in cement plant? Coal is the main fuel for manufacture of cement in India, due to high cost and inadequate availability of oil and gas. The consumption of coal in dry process system ranges from 20-25% of clinker production. That means 0.20-0.25 t of coal is consumed to produce one tonne of clinker.

## Raw Material Substitution - Cembureau
The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone. Limestone is abundantly available, but over 60% of the industry's CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime, called "decarbonation". Accordingly, part of the route towards a low carbon concrete-built environment can involve limestone substitution.

## Raw Materials
The labs also analyze and test the finished product to ensure that it complies with all industry specifications. The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed.
