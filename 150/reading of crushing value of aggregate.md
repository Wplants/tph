After each layer, tamp 25 times for good compaction. Then take the weight of the cylinder with aggregate. Place the apparatus, with the test sample and plunger in position on the compression testing machine. Apply the compressive load of 40 tons in 10 mins. Then remove the specimen from machine and sieve the aggregates through 2.36 mm.

The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load. When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place.

##  Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV) (BS 
the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve. For other size fractions, there is another recommended method.

## Aggregate Crushing Value - Significance & Test Procedure
The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.
