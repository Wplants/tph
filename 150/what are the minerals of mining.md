Strip mining. Strip mining is the activity of removing a layer of earth to access the minerals that are in shallow deposits and continuing to do the same in adjacent areas without digging deeper vertically. Strip mining is best suited for shallow and horizontally located deposits. Strip mining activities often impacts a broader surface area.

The U.S. mining industry consists of the search for, extraction, beneficiation, and processing of naturally occurring solid materials from the earth. Materials and minerals can include coal, iron, copper, and zinc. Other mining sites focus on rock such as limestone, potash, and various gravel types.

## The stages of mining: 5 lifecycle processes explained
Strip Mining involves stripping the surface away from the mineral that's being excavated (usually coal). Soil, rock, and vegetation over the mineral seam is removed with huge machines, including bucket-wheel excavators. Open-Pit Mining is a technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open-air pit.
