##  Restoring Mine Dumps - Ergofito
Tailings, also called mine dumps, culm dumps, slimes, tails, refuse, leach residue or slickens, are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable frac-tion from the uneconomic fraction (gangue) of an ore. Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or materials overlying an ore or mineral body

Ways to do this: 1. Lots of mulch. Fungal dominated soils tend to have a heavy layer of biomass on the soil surface. You can jumpstart this with lots of wood chips or other lignin-heavy plant mass. Chop and drop pruning is a good way to get biomass onto the soil surface. 2.

## Mine Waste Transfer and Disposal Methods - Mine Tailings, Gangue
First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore. This additional waste rock is called gangue.

In the case of mine waste facilities, the objectives are simple: Design the structure such that it will retain the material behind it, and still be stable. Try to make the structure take up as little space as possible. In the case of point 1, the rock slope or tailings dam slope should be as flat as possible to return maximum stability.
