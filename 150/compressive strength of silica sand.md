## Which green sand properties should you control per molding equipment 
Composition of green sand molding mixture for iron foundries typically consists of 100 parts silica sand, 8 parts bentonite clay and other additions like carbon ( 0,3 parts ) or cereals and 3 % water content. It's called " green" because the mold strength is developed with mechanical (compression) stress; not by a chemical reaction nor heat.
