## Brazilian alexandrite, Hematita
In 1987 a major strike of alexandrite was made at Hematita. As soon as news of the find leaked out, three thousand garimpeiros (independent prospectors) descended on the small valley, five hundred feet wide by six hundred fifty feet long, and began to dig. This "Alexandrite-rush" lasted about four months during the spring and summer of 1987.

The tailings had a significant content of iron (from 44% to 64%), mainly in the form of hematite (α-Fe2O3) and goethite (α-FeOOH). Mössbauer results showed that the amount of goethite increased as the particle size decreased. Furthermore, the hematite content was always greater in the coarser fractions (>10 μm).

Mine tailings in African countries Zambia and Namibia have been investigated with an objective to determine the role of secondary hematite in immobilization of contaminants. Two sites, Chambishi and Mindolo, are located in the Copperbelt in Zambia with relatively humid climates and two sites, Berg Aukas and Kombat, are in Namibia, where the climate is semiarid.
