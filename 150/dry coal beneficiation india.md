## Dry beneficiation of coal: A review - eprints@NML
To intensify the production of coal, mechanisation of coal mining is gradually increasing. The process, being less selective, increases the quantity of shales, stones and other impurities in coal. Dry methods of separation of these impurities may serve as a preconcentration step prior to wet processes of beneficiation. Dry beneficiation will eliminate the energy intensive process of dewatering
