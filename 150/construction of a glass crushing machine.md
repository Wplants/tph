## What are Construction Crushers? How Construction Crusher Works?
A construction crusher signifies a piece of equipment that is intended to reduce the size of large rocks or gravel, for construction purposes. Crushers can also be utilized to transform the shape of waste matter for simplicity in disposal, or recycling. Crushers are also employed for reducing the raw materials mix size for their differentiation, and segregation.

Sep 18, 2020Glass crushers are machines designed with the aim of pulverizing glass to aid in the recycling process. Waste glass comes from various sources, in the form of glass sheets, containers, jars and bottles, and can be recycled with the help of a glass crusher to avoid generating new glass, which in turn saves energy.
