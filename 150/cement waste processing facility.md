Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

RDF, or Refuse Derived Fuel, uses a technology that produces energy from waste that's unsuitable for traditional recycling. Without this method of energy recovery, non-recyclable refuse would simply be sent to landfill or be incinerated - with a negative impact on the environment. RDF captures the energy in non-recyclable waste and turns it.
