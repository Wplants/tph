Figure 8 shows the distribution of the bulk density, with the distribution concentrated in the 1700 2000 kg/m3 range. It can be observed that the bulk density follows a normal distribution, and the most probable value is in the 1800 1900 kg/m3 range. Determination of the Atterberg limits is important for the investigation of soil behavior.

As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft.

## Bulking/Swell of Excavated or Mined Materials
The same excavation in feet: Excavated area is 200 feet long 20 feet wide and 2 feet deep with a listed swell of 40% for the material. Bank volume = 200  20  2 = 8000 ft³. Convert 8000 ft³ to yd³ = 8000/27 = 296 yd³. Loose volume = 296  1.4 = 414 yd³. (Calculations are based on the material being of similar consistency.

## bulk density of 3/4 stone - CR4 Discussion Thread - GlobalSpec
For gravel, the bulk density can be higher up to 130 lbs/cf as the voids are filled with sand and smaller (than 3/4") stone. We need to know the gradation of the gravel to answer this question (which has yet to have been asked. However, it is up to Mr. Guest to clarify this point and he seems to have stepped away.

## crushed granite bulk density
crushed granite bulk density. Stone, crushed density in 285 units of density measurement. Stone, crushed weighs 1602 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 602 kilogram per cubic meter, ie density of stone, crushed is equal to 1 602 kg/m³ In Imperial or US customary measurement system, the density is equal to 100 pound per cubic foot lb/ft³, or 0926
