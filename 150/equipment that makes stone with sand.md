Divide the mass of the sand by the volume of the sand. Calculate the air space volume. It will be equal to the volume of the sand alone plus the volume of the water alone minus the volume of the sand/water mixture. Calculate the fractional air space. Another way to measure the air space is as a percentage of the total volume of the sand.
