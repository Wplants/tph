Sulfidic copper ores are too dilute for direct smelting. Smelting these materials would require too much energy and very large furnace capacities. The copper ore coming from the mine (0.5 - 1 % Cu) must be concentrated by beneficiation. The valuable minerals like chalcopyrite are intergrown with gangue.

Heap leaching accounts for around 20% of the global production of copper. In heap leaching coarsely crushed ore particles are contacted with an aqueous lixiviant percolating through large packed beds (heaps) of the ore particles, with the loaded solution collected at the foot of the heap for metal recovery, solution make-up and recycle.

Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Smelting | Encyclopedia
Smelting Mined ores are processed to concentrate the minerals of interest. In the case of metal ores, these mineral concentrates usually need to be further processed to separate the metal from other elements in the ore minerals.  Copper and selenium, for example, which can be released from copper smelters, are essential to organisms as trace

3. EXTRACTION OF COPPER • Copper is mainly extracted from its sulfide ores by smelting. • Following steps are involved in the extraction of copper: 4. CONCENTRATION • Finely crushed ore is concentrated by FROTH FLOATATION PROCESS. • Crushed ore is suspended in water containing a little amount of pine oil.
