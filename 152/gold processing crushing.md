Stages 1 and 2: Bashing and Mashing. Traditionally, the process selection choice was between a conventional, well-tried, three-stage crushing circuit followed by ball-milling, or single-stage crushing followed by a Semi-Autogenous (SAG) mill and ball mill. The latter is preferred for wet sticky ores to minimize transfer point chute blockages

By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.
