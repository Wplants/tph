Since base-course materials are near the surface of the road or airfield, the amount of strength loss during thawing periods will have a strong influence on the life of the facility.

## What's a Road Base Driveway & Should You Get One? | NK - NK Asphalt
Mar 1, 2021Base materials can be granite roadbase, crushed gravel or limestone, which are then compacted to form a hard surface. They are frequently used in the construction of roads, paving substrates, hard stands, parking areas, footpaths and driveways. It is a cost-effective solution as it is inexpensive to install and doesn't crack easily.
