## The Beneficiation Method of Rare Earth Minerals - JXSC Machine
Oct 27, 20211. Radiation Beneficiation Method. It mainly uses the difference in thorium content between rare earth minerals and gangue minerals in the ore, and uses a γ-ray radiation concentrator to separate rare earth minerals from gangue minerals. The radiation beneficiation method is mostly used for the pre-selection of rare earth ore.

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Iron ore beneficiation can be brought about through three approaches, namely, selective dissolution, microbially induced flotation, and selective flocculation-dispersion.  Such oxide particles are processed in plants in diverse fields from pharmaceuticals to natural ore beneficiation by standard separation methods, such as froth flotation

## CNA - Beneficiation method for recovering chrome lump ore 
The invention discloses a beneficiation method for recovering chrome lump ore. The method comprises the following processing steps: crushing the chrome ore, and classifying three particle size grades including 20-15mm, 15-6mm and 6-2mm by narrow level screening; respectively carrying out dry-type strong magnetic separation on the three classified particle size grades obtained by screening by
