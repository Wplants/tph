## Quartz vs. Fused Silica: What are the Differences?
Aug 4, 2021There is often interchangeable use of the terms "fused quartz" and "fused silica". However, "fused quartz" more specifically refers to an amorphous solid formed by melting naturally occurring quartz. This means that while fused silica is ostensibly pure SiO 2, fused quartz contains impurities dependent on what quartz was used.

Summary. There are many differences between glass and quartz. The first one lies in the silicone dioxide content; glass has roughly eighty percent, while quartz can contain over ninety percent. As an amorphous substance, glass has a random molecular structure, while quartz has a symmetrical molecular structure.

Crystalline silica (quartz) is the form of silica that OSHA is writing the new regulations to cover, it is a health hazard. It is not reactive with portland cement, meaning it does not cause ASR (alkali-silica reactivity) regardless of particle size. Lots of countertop makers use 30 to 40 mesh crystalline silica sand in their GFRC mixes.
