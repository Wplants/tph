## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of portland and other types of hydraulic cement, in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.

The kiln must work continuously to ensure a steady regime and uniformity of the clinker. A conventional, larger kiln in a wet process plant produces 3600 tons of clinker per day. Cement manufacturing by wet the process is energy-intensive, so it is uneconomical compared to dry process and semi-dry process.

## Cement Kilns: Wet and semi-wet process kilns
The cost of evaporating the water in the kiln is the reason why the wet process is now extinct. To evaporate 1 kg of water requires 2442.6 kJ of latent heat at 25°C. But in addition, the temperature must be raised to 100°C at least, requiring another 182.6 kJ of sensible heat.

## cement plant wet process
The cement industry has boosted efficiency by concentrating new capital investment in plants that use the dry process of cement manufacture, and by phasing out operations that rely on the more energyintensive wet process. Since 1974, the number of wet process kilns has dropped from 234 to 25 a decline of 89 percent while the number of
