May 18, 2022Limestone is a sedimentary rock. When you use pulverized limestone, it serves as a catalyst for bacterial soil activity and creates stronger soil. It also assists with compost disintegration. When this happens, the soil becomes more porous, making it possible for more air to circulate through it and store essential water nutrients.

## Calcination
In limestone calcination, a decomposition process that occurs at 900 to 1050 °C, the chemical reaction is . CaCO 3 (s) → CaO(s) + CO 2 (g). Today, this reaction largely occurs in a cement kiln.. The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction in [J/mol] is approximated as ΔG° r ≈ 177,100 J/mol − 158 J/(molK)  T. The standard free energy of reaction is 0 in this case when the temperature
