## Bentonite: Applications With Coal as Bentonite-Clay - African Pegmatite
Mar 10, 2021Summary. Bentonite is a type of clay that is prized for its porosity, workability and non-toxic nature. In foundry applications, it is used with coal (bentonite-coal) in sand/green sand molding for metal castings; where it enhances the refractory properties of the mold whilst also increasing strength and flowability.
