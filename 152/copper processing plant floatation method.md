## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
Only the flotation process mentioned above could make this practicable; and even so, it requires large companies with huge plants, continuous working and immense capital. This explains why, in order to smelt 4 million tons of new copper in 1963, nearly 400 million tons of ore had to be handled and treated in various ways. Flotation depends on

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Flotation, when first introduced between 1913 and 1916, was used primarily to reduce losses of copper in the fine tailings of gravity plants. From an accessory to gravity methods, flotation very rapidly became a major process and finally, from 1923 to 1927, all but eliminated the gravity method in the treatment of low-grade sulfide copper ores.

## 2 Flotation Methods for Copper Oxide - Mining-pedia
Jul 27, 2021Froth flotation is a method of separating ores using the difference in physical and chemical properties of mineral surfaces. It is currently the main method for the flotation of copper oxide. Relatively speaking, froth flotation can be used to separate malachite and azurite. However, chrysocolla and copper phosphate are difficult to float.
