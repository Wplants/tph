Recycling also saves energy that would otherwise be used to mine, process, or transport new aggregates, which is also beneficial to the environment. Using a recycled aggregate also offers its own set of benefits. For instance, CA6 recycled is 15% lighter than virgin CA6, which means that you get 15% more volume per ton with your order.

## Concrete recycling
Concrete recycling is the use of rubble from demolished concrete structures. Recycling is cheaper and more ecological than trucking rubble to a landfill. Crushed rubble can be used for road gravel, revetments, retaining walls, landscaping gravel, or raw material for new concrete.Large pieces can be used as bricks or slabs, or incorporated with new concrete into structures, a material called

The procedure of crushing the stone has three stages. The first stage is breaking down the stone to small sizes. The second stage is crushing down the sizable stones to suit a specific purpose. On the third stage, the stones are screened for finished products. Sand and gravel are the most common minerals used in creating concrete.

It is found that recycled coarse aggregate are reduced to various sizes during the process of crushing and sieving, which gives the best particle size distribution. The amounts of fine particles less than 4.75mm after recycling of demolished waste were in the order of 5-20% depending upon the original grade of demolished concrete.

Recycled aggregate comes primarily from PCC and AC from road rehabilitation and maintenance, demolition, and leftover batches of AC and PCC. After processing, the rocks retain bits of cement or asphalt. A roadway is built in several layers: pavement, base, and sometimes subbase. The pavement is the surface layer, and is made of PCC or AC.
