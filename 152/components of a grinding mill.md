## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
Ball Mill Components. Drum - the drum is the cylindrical casing of the ball mill.  At critical speed, the grinding mill charge clings to the mill inner surface and does not tumble. Most ball mills operate at approximately 75% critical speed, as this is determined to be the optimum speed. The true optimum speed depends upon the drum diameter.

## Hammer mills : an engineering overview. What is it ? How it works
The hammer mill design is very robust and is used in many applications, from grain milling to heavy duty requirements such as rock crushing or waste grinding. Hammer mills are part of the impact mill family, which means that the milling effect is obtained thanks to the speed at which particles are impacted, here, by one or several rotors. 2.
