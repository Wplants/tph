## Coal mining
A coal mine in Frameries, Belgium. Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job. Many more perished from occupational diseases, but weren't tallied in official statistics. Miners were crushed to death in roof collapses, killed by gas explosions and by machinery, and more.

## Learn About Wyoming Coal Mining.
Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.

Coal mining in the early days was a hard, dangerous job. Thousands of Wyoming miners lost their lives from explosions and fires. More than 300 miners died in disasters between 1886 and 1924. Black lung disease, from long exposure to coal dust, also plagued miners. Most of these dangers were connected with miners working in cramped mine shafts

Coal mining began in Ohio during the 1810s and 1820s. Most of Ohio's coal mines existed in eastern and southern parts of the state. Prior to the 1810s, most Ohioans heated their homes or operated their machinery with firewood. As Ohioans cleared the land to farm it, an abundance of firewood resulted, reducing the need for coal.
