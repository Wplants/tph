Shamans prepare yopo snuff from the toasted pulverized seeds of either Anadenanthera colubrina or Anadenanthera peregrina which is then mixed with water and a source of a calcium carbonate. Calcined shells are often used as the source of calcium carbonate. The mixture is kneaded while wet and allowed to sit and react, often overnight.

Robert makes an excellent point here! Just try soaking a hard boiled egg in vinegar overnight. This will extract all of the calcium from the shell (1 shell is about 2000mg calcium). The vinegar causes the carbonate to be separated from the calcium. The carbonate evaporates as bubbles, and the calcium is left in the vinegar.
