## Increasing Manufacturing Efficiency With A Heat Efficient Ceramic Kiln
The biggest ongoing resource expenditure in the ceramics industry is energy for use on heat (up to 30% of total costs in some plants). Kilns, furnaces, dryers and ovens eat through a large amount of fuel and energy on each production run. The sad thing is that as equipment progresses through its life-cycle it becomes less and less energy efficient.
