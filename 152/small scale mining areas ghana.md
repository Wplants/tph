## How "Small" Is Small-Scale Gold Mining? - City University of New York
Small-scale mining accounts for 10-15% of the worlds gold supply. Small-scale gold mining isn't really that small in reality. Workers employ a variety of methods and mining techniques. They pan for gold, dredge rivers, manually dig up ground with shovels, work with hydraulic systems, use mechanized crushers, and often utilize large earth

## Ghana needs to re-think its small scale mining strategy. Here's how
Apr 20, 2021Ghana is among the top two gold producers in Africa.What has caught little attention, however, is the fact that more than 35% of total gold output in Ghana comes from artisanal and small-scale miners. Artisanal and small-scale mining is estimated to support the livelihoods of some 4.5 million Ghanaians, about 12% of the population.They account for more than 60% of the country's mining sector
