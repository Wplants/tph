If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.
