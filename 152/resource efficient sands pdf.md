##  Urban Metabolism for Resource-efficient Cities
The concept of urban metabolism has furthered quantitative approaches to urban resource flows assessment and inspired ideas about designing sustainable cities (Agudelo-Vera et al., 2012, Castán Broto et al., 2012, Zhang, 2013), which in turn, allows for the identification of leverage points for resource-efficiency interventions.
