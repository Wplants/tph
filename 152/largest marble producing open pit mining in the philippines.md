## Winning a battle but not the war against open-pit mining
Nov 3, 2020Published: November 03, 2020 09:05 AM GMT. Catholic bishops in the Philippines have long fought against open-pit mining — a surface method of extracting rock or minerals from an open-air pit otherwise known as a "borrow" mine or a "quarry.". Holes are drilled to check if rocks or soil contain minerals.
