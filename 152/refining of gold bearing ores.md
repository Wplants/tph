## uranium processing - Leaching | Britannica
Roasted uranium ores are leached of their uranium values by both acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions. For the successful operation of all leaching systems, uranium must either be initially present in the more stable hexavalent state or be oxidized to that state in the leaching process. Acid leaching is commonly performed by agitating an ore-leach mixture for 4 to as long as 48 hours at

Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

## Thiosulfate Leaching of Gold from Copper Bearing Ores
The recovery of gold and silver from a copper-bearing gold ore sample obtained from southern New Mexico was investigated using agitation leaching, bottle-roll and column leach techniques. These experiments were carried out with a low grade ore analyzing 2.1 g/t Au (0.061 ± 0.008 oz/ton), 56.7 g/t Ag (1.65 ± 0.12 oz/ton), and 0.86% acid

## gold refining prcess from ore
Outline of the Process. The gold refining technique described here is the rather ancient wet chemical method whereby the gold-bearing scrap is dissolved in aqua-regia. m is gold solution is then filtered and the jewelers bench dirt, sandpaper grit, grinding wheel grains and similar material remains on the filter as a solid sludge, together with
