## Types of Drilling Patterns for Underground Mining
The primary techniques used for underground mining include diamond core, reverse circulation, and rotary air drilling. Diamond core drilling is the popular choice because it is highly accurate, and produces minimal debris, dust, and noise. The following are the drilling patterns that can apply to your mining process.

## 4 Types of Rock Drill - Mining-pedia
Sep 30, 2021A rock drill is a piece of equipment used in mining. It drills a hole in the rock so that explosives can be placed to blow up the rock, thus completing the mining of ore or other rock projects. The rock drill is divided into pneumatic rock drill, hydraulic rock drill, electric rock drill,diesel rock drill according to the power source. This article will introduce you one by one.

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

For the first time, jack-up rigs provided a stable platform from which to drill oil offshore. Soon, these rigs appeared all over U.S. coasts. The first jack-up rig was invented in 1954, but technological advances continued to improve it into the 1980s and 90s. As of 2013, 540 jack-up rigs are still in use offshore all over the world.

## Get to Know the Common Types of Mining Equipment
Dec 21, 2020The type of drill selected depends on the drill method used - which in turn depends largely on the type of material being mined. For example, reverse circulation (RC) drilling is often used in mineral exploration. In RC drilling, a hammer (actually a pneumatic reciprocating piston) drives a drill bit made of tungsten-steel into the rock.

## Directional Drilling: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know
Directional drilling is a broad term used to describe any boring that doesn't go in a straight line vertically down. In fact, even in a vertical well, it might be necessary to deviate to avoid a geological formation or a previous stuck pipe, then return to the original path. In this instance, the driller uses sidetracking techniques.

Drill collars are a component of the drill string that makes up part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). They are thicker-walled, heavier, and more rigid than drill pipes and are primarily used to weigh down the drill bit while dampening vibration and impact forces. Drill collars are typically machined from solid carbon steel bar stock.
