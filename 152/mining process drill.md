## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling - Trimantec
Drilling creates a round hole in a workpiece. A drill press or tapping machine is designed for drilling, but this process can also be performed using a milling machine. Chips are the bits of waste metal produced when machining a workpiece. The shape of the drill bit helps chips fall away from the workpiece, keeping the workpiece free of debris.

Drill and Blast Areas for open-pit mining are selected using the mine plan. Identified areas are tagged, and then holes are drilled in an appropriate pattern by rigs. The drill holes are filled with an explosive, most often ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate/Fuel Oil) and then charged. The resulting blast breaks the material to a size required for digging.

One of the most important aspects of underground hard rock mining is ventilation.Ventilation is the primary method of clearing hazardous gases and/or dust which are created from drilling and blasting activity (e.g., silica dust, NOx), diesel equipment (e.g., diesel particulate, carbon monoxide), or to protect against gases that are naturally emanating from the rock (e.g., radon gas).

STEP 3: Cementing and Testing. Once the target distance is reached, the drill pipe is removed and steel pipe is pushed to the bottom. This "well casing" is cemented in place. Rigorous tests are performed to ensure the pipe is impermeable before any production of natural gas or oil can occur.

The process begins by drilling a hole deep into the earth. To do this, a long bit attached to a "drilling string" is used. The bit varies in diameter from five to 50 inches. After each section is drilled, a steel pipe slightly smaller than the hole diameter is dropped in and often cement is used to fill the gap.

RC drills can occasionally get parts stuck in the ground as the drill bit wears down and the rods need to be recovered as they are very expensive. This can be a time consuming process and can on occasion set a project back by weeks. To combat this, many companies will consistently re-grind the tungsten nodules off the drill bit. Applications

## Drilling Methods Used in Coal Mines | Geology for Investors
Coring ( diamond drilling) is another way of collecting information about a potential coal resource. The drill rig is equipped with a hollow tube, and as the drill pushes the rods into the ground, a cylindrical piece of the rock is pushed into the hollow tube. These samples are usually the length of a drill rod, which is 6 meters.
