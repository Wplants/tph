Sand is critical to flat glass manufacturing since it is the principal source of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) which is essential for producing glass [2]. A high proportion of silica in the sand composition (above 95%) is therefore required together with a high level of chemical purity. This quality of raw materials is all the more important for flat

## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Glass. Glass is manufactured by heating a mixture of silica sand and various metallic oxides/carbonates together in a furnace to a smooth and bubble-free melt at ∼1500°C. The usual glass used in the construction industry is soda glass. Formulations are very variable but typically might be: SiO 2. 70-75%.
