##  Evaluation of Horticulture Applications of Light Expanded Clay 
Expandable Clay Aggregates (LECA) (Bragdon, 1996). Gases form as clay materials are fired, causing an expansion that, when cooled, leaves a cellular pore structure in the interior and exterior of the aggregates. The end result of the process is a structural grade lightweight aggregate with a low bulk density (Spomer, 1998).

## Expanded Clay - Brimak Terre cuite
Expanded or expandable clay aggregate is a commonly used hydroponic grow medium. It is a lightweight aggregate that is heated in a kiln oven to a temperature of 1,200 degrees Celsius. Once the aggregate is heated, it releases gases, which create small bubbles that make a honeycomb-like structure inside of the aggregate.

Nov 19, 2020Expanded clay pebbles look like small, marble-sized balls of clay, although they are slightly oddly-shaped and just semi-rounded, rather than being perfect spheres. They are produced in a rotary kiln - pure clay is heated up to temperatures over 2000°F, which separates it into small pebbly units while filling each one with tiny air bubbles.
