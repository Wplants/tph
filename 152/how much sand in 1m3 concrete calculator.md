## Sand Calculator - How much sand do you need in tons / tonnes or cubic 
A ton of sand is typically about 0.750 cubic yards (3/4 cu yd), or 20 cubic feet. Sand is assumed relatively damp, since adding water can increase or decrease the density of the sand considerably (e.g. if it was raining or if you dig up and leave sand under the sun so water evaporates).

Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags

For concrete, the procedure for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. You need to divide the total cubic yards that the yield needs to determine the number of concrete bags you need. Use the following yields per each bag size: 40-pound bag yields .011 cubic yards. 60-pound bag yields .017 cubic yards.
