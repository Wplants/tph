## Powder Metallurgy - Powder Production
The major world producer of iron powder manufactures powder by the reduction of iron oxide either in the form of a pure iron ore, or as pure mill-scale from a large rolling mill. In either case an irregular, spongy powder is produced, with a particle size of minus 100 mesh, that is the powder will go through a standard sieve of 100 mesh as

## Production of powders and granules - Pharmaceutical
Production of crystalline powders. Crystallization is the production of solid crystals in a solution of the solute being crystallized, which is followed by the subsequent separation of those crystals from the solution. Crystallization is accomplished by creating a state of supersaturation of the solute in a solution.

Tungsten powder is mainly produced by the hydrogen reduction of high-purity tungsten oxides. Oxides are produced using ammonium paratungstate (APT). Tungsten trioxide and tungsten blue oxide tend to be the starting materials. This reduction takes place in pusher furnaces. Powder passes through the furnace in boats or in rotary furnaces.

In this process, the compounds of metals such as iron oxides are reduced with CO or H2 at temperatures below the melting point of the metal in an atmosphere controlled furnace. The reduced product is then crushed and ground. Iron powder is produced in this way. Fe3O4 + 4C = 3Fe + 4CO. Fe3O4 + 4CO = 3Fe + 4CO2.

## Main methods of production of metal powders - Eurobalt Engineering
The Spray Method is one of the most efficient methods for producing metallic powders. It is being done with the help of special devices for spraying molten metal. In this case, the metal interacts with compressed air and is sent to the water. Due to this, the manufactured parts will be durable. You can also get molten metal.

## Salt Production and Processing - Morton Salt
Most mine shafts are lined with a concrete wall called a shaft liner. Salt is mined by the room and pillar method. It is removed in a checkerboard pattern to leave permanent, solid salt pillars for mine roof support. Usually 45 to 65 percent of the salt is removed. The room height may average 18 feet in a bedded deposit to 100 feet in a dome mine.
