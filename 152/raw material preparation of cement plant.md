## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## Raw Material Preparation | Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Raw material preparation aims to preare a mixture that has the right chemical composition and particle size necessary for the clinker production. For plants that receive their raw materials already crushed, this stage usually involves grinding (milling), classification, mixing and storage. Ball mills, tube mills, vertical or horizontal roller mills are commonly used for grinding. The
