## Progresses in restoration of post-mining landscape in Africa
In South Africa, dredge mining for heavy minerals such as rutile, ilmenite, and zircon in coastal dunes has taken place in Zululand since 1977 (Cooke and Johnson 2002). The heavy minerals are separated from the sand using a floating dredger that pumps the sand in slurry to a gravity separator, thereafter the mined sand is pumped back as tailings.

This region is known as the copper belt and cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper mining. The majority (around 65-85%) of all cobalt mined in the DRC comes from large scale copper mines that are mostly operated by large multinational mining companies. The operations in these mines are strictly controlled by the operators and local governments.
