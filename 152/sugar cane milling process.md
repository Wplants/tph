## Sugar Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Sugar is produced in two principal ways, from beet or cane. In beet production sugar is extracted or leached from sliced sugar beets (cossettes), after which juice is purified through a series of milk of lime and CO 2 process steps. The filtered juice is evaporated (thickened) and sugar is crystallized from it.

In the milling process we produce molasses - the dark syrup that remains after sugar crystals have been removed from the cane juice.. On average, our mills produce 500,000 tonnes of molasses a year. About 235,000 tonnes of this is fermented in our Sarina Distillery to produce ethanol and agricultural products.. A portion is also sold for use in the livestock industry.

Milling Clarification: The process involves removing impurities from the sugar cane or sugar beet juice. It is mostly done by adding lime to it to neutralise the organic acids present in it. The solution is later heated up to 95℃. The heating helps in coagulation and the impurities settle in the bottom, which is then removed.
