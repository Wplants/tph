Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

## Extraction of Metals - Methods of Extraction of Metals from Ores - BYJUS
The extraction of metals and their isolation occurs over a few major steps: Concentration of Ore - Here the ore is separated from earthy impurities. Isolation of metal from concentrated Ore - Here the ore is converted to its oxide form and then reduced. The steps involved are either calcination or roasting and then heating with a reducing
