## Maine Geological Survey: History of Quarrying in Maine
Limestone quarrying began in the early 1800's and continues today. Small amounts of impure limestone have been quarried in many parts of the state, but the only place that has produced a significant amount of lime is the Rockland-Thomaston area. The "limestone" there is a metamorphosed coarse-grained marble, some of which is quite pure.

It's usually uniform in quality and thickness, but limestone quarries can be long-lived because of the abundance. Mining can take place under hundreds of miles and many areas of quarry miles. Many different quarries will put together several different products and some crushed rocks that are impure can be used for road items. Using Limestone
