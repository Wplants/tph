## Mineralogical, chemical, and physical characteristics of iron ore
Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) is a common iron ore mineral in iron ore deposits of metasedimentary and magmatic origin.Magnetite has an inverse spinel structure and is partly altered in near-surface environments to hematite or kenomagnetite (Waychunas, 1991).Hematite is commonly thought to form from oxidation of magnetite in the near-surface environment although Ohmoto (2003) demonstrated that the

Hematite is the most important iron ore. The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime, magnesia, manganese, and iron. It is of valuable composition, carries only 14 or 15% of iron, and is used more for its lime and magnesia as a flux than for its iron-content.

## In its powdered form the mineral hematite?
What is hematite made of?

## elemental composition of hematite in iron ore
Characterization of Chemical Composition and. The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (south-western Uganda). The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production.

## iron | Element, Occurrence, Uses, Properties, & Compounds
Sep 6, 2022Iron is also found combined with other elements in hundreds of minerals; of greatest importance as iron ore are hematite (ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3), magnetite (triiron tetroxide, Fe 3 O 4), limonite (hydrated ferric oxide hydroxide, FeO(OH)∙nH 2 O), and siderite (ferrous carbonate, FeCO 3). Igneous rocks average about 5 percent iron content.
