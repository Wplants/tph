To understand the pricing breakdown for your countertop, material prices are based off of finished materials by square foot. The stone material makes up approximately 25%-50% of your final price per square foot. Readily available stonesâsuch as Ubatubaâtend to make up a lower percentage, and tend to contribute to a lower portion of the job.
