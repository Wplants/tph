## Uranium Geology - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
How is the uranium extracted from the ore: Ore from pit or underground mining is crushed and slurried to the mill a weak acid or alkaline solution in hydrogen peroxide to oxidize solution is added so that the uranium dissolves. The uranium is then filtered to remove the now spent solids leaving just the pregnant leachate.

In some circumstances, ore may be mined by in situ recovery, a process that dissolves the uranium while still underground and then pumps a uranium-bearing solution to the surface. Open pit mining. When uranium ore is found near the surface, generally less than 100 metres deep, it is typically extracted by open pit mining.

Depending on the deposit, uranium is mined in one of three ways: open pit, underground, or in situ recovery. Open pit. When uranium is found near the surface - usually no more than 100 meters deep - it can be extracted via open pit mining. In this method, soil and waste rock is removed by heavy equipment, allowing the ore to be accessed.

Jan 18, 20212 Answers. With a half-life of 4 billion years, uranium is only very weakly radioactive. In fact, since uranium is a heavy metal, its chemical toxicity is actually more of a danger than its radioactivity. If you touch it directly with your hands, you should wash your hands afterwards. You should not eat it.

Radon atoms formed from the decay of 226 Ra within the solid grains of the materials may not be released to the pore space due to their very low diffusion coefficients (10 â25 -10 â27 m 2 s â1) in solid grains (Nazaroff et al. 1988; Semkow 1991).
