## Deposit model for heavy-mineral sands in coastal environments
This report provides a descriptive model of heavy-mineral sands, which are sedimentary deposits of dense minerals that accumulate with sand, silt, and clay in coastal environments, locally forming economic concentrations of the heavy minerals. This deposit type is the main source of titanium feedstock for the titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigments industry, through recovery of the minerals ilmenite

On any sand beach there are thin layers of dark sand that can be seen. Some heavy minerals contain valuable metals, such as titanium, zirconium, germanium, tin, uranium, and gold. In many places the concentrations are so great that they are of industrial significance; placer deposits are worked in India, Brazil, Japan, Australia, Russia, and

## Processing of Beach Sand Minerals of Maharastra
INTRODUCTION India has large reserves of beach sand minerals in the coastal stretches around the country. Among these, ilmanite is the largest constituent of the minerals other being rutile, leucoxene, zircon, sillimanite, garnet and monazite. Ilmenite and rutile are exploitable minerals of beach sand and they also occur in fully liberated state.

## Make in India: Possibilities and Challenges in Beach Sand Minerals 
The beach sand mining in India is more than one century old. The first mining was started in 1908 when the beach sand containing monazite was mined and taken to European countries from the erstwhile Travancore state. Subsequently, processing facilities were set up to separate the minerals like monazite, ilmenite etc. in Manavalakurichi

## Monazite chemistry and its distribution along the coast  - SpringerLink
The beach sand mineral industry in India owes its growth to the discovery of monazite, a complex phosphate of rare earth elements . Monazite occurs in the beach placer deposit along with other heavy minerals such as ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, zircon, sillimanite, and garnet. The monazite is separated as a by-product of titanium minerals.

## Separation of Beach Sand Minerals - eprints@NML
India has a vast resource of beach sand minerals along the Eastern and the Western coastal lines. The Beach Sand Minerals are usually heavier due to higher specific gravity and because of this property these are also known as Heavy Minerals. The Heavy Minerals are themselves a mixture of a variety of minerals like monazite, ilntenite, rutile, zircon. silimanite, garner etc.
