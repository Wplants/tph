Significance of Grading The aggregates are graded as per IS code 383, when the aggregate size is less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate & more than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate. The aggregate gradation is determined by the fineness modulus method where aggregates are passing through the sieve as per IS standard to classify its size.

## Practical Grading of Aggregates | Concrete Technology
The suitability of the fine sand of zone 4 for use in reinforced concrete should be tested. For sands, the sand content of the mix should be low whose greater part is smaller than 60C micron. In general, finer the grading of the fine aggregate, higher should be the coarse/fine aggregate ratio. Typical values are shown in Table 4.23.

## proceso calculation method of various sizes of aggregates from
A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregates. Grading of aggregates is aimed at determining the mean size of the particle in a given batch of aggregates. This is commonly found by the Method of Fineness Modulus. The method can be used to determine fineness modulus of coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and allin aggregates,, mixed aggregates.
