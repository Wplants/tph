## What Is #57 Stone? - Dirt Connections
Crushed stone varies in size. The number "57" is a number that refers to the size sieve that was used to screen and sort the stone. It means that the stone was put through the #57 sieve which produces gravel stones of about 1" to 1.5" in size. #1 crushed stone refers to the largest sized crushed stone. It is about 2″ to 4″ in size.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Gradation and Size - Pavement Interactive
The particle size distribution, or gradation, of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material. In HMA, gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness, stability, durability, permeability, workability, fatigue resistance, frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et

Description. CR6 is a crushed gravel or stone used as a base material with the average size is 1/8″ inches down to dust. However slightly bigger chunks are possible due to crushing. CR6 comes in a variety of colors sure to fit your project needs. This stone is usually not made for landscaping projects and is used to fill the voids between
