## 'Parsec' is the unit measurement of - MCQ - MCQtimes
Correct Answer: Astronomical distance. One parsec is the distance to an object whose parallax angle is one arcsecond. The radius of the Earth's orbit equals one astronomical unit (AU), so an object that is one parsec distant is 206,265 AU (or 3.26 light-years) away. rikazzz | November 9, 2021 | Physics.

## Interpretations of quantum mechanics
These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is deterministic or stochastic,  Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to instrumentalism.
