## Why open pit mines? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022Why is open pit mining cheaper? Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc.

## Open pit mining - SlideShare
The term open pit mining is usually used for metallic or non-metallic deposits and sparingly used for bedded deposits like coal. A quarry is a type of open pit mine used to mine building materials (construction aggregate, riprap, sand and gravel) and dimension stones usually at shallower depths. 3. 3 The term quarry has traditionally been used

## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

1.What is open pit mining？ Open pit mining is the process of removing the covering from the ore body to obtain the desired minerals. Open-pit mining can be divided into open-pit metal deposit mining, open-pit coal mining, and open-pit iron mining.The former mainly mines non-ferrous metals, the middle mainly mines coal and some non-metallic ores, and the latter mainly mines iron ore.

## Everything You Need To Know About Open Pit Mining - Positive Points
Open pit mining is one of mankind's greatest achievements in the ongoing search for precious ores such as copper, silver, iron, and gold.  There was a time when the most common way to extract ore was shaft mining resulting in thousands of deaths. Cave-ins, noxious fumes, gas events and accidental traumas related to equipment were on the rise

## MINING Equipment List Mining Tools Names + Underground + Open pit
What is open pit mining? Open pit mining is the most common mining technology when it comes to new mines. In this technique, the soil is excavated and the mineral separation and the remaining soil material occurs on the surface. The first step in this process is the extraction of the ore (beta with high mineral grade).

## Strip Mining, Open-pit Mining, Surface Mining, Mining Techniques 
Strip mining is a kind of surface mining. The ore is very near to the surface of the land but has one or more layers of rock and filth on top of it. To mine the ore, these layers have to be removed. The steps in strip mining are similar to open-pit mining.

## ore equipment used in open pit copper mining
In open pit copper mining, the ore is broken free and reduced to a manageable size by blasting. Huge shovels are used to load the broken ore into haul trucks, which take it to the crusher. The copper extraction process takes place through openpit mining using largescale equipment.
