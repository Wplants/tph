## Mitsubishi Power | Types of Coal
Types of Coal. There are various types of coal, from anthracite with its high carbon content to bituminous coal, subbituminous coal and lignite (brown coal), which is an even younger coal. Power generating equipment needs to be optimized for these different types of coal. Mitsubishi Power is able to supply the optimum power generating equipment
