In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

During secondary crushing, the background concentrations were achieved at a 350 m distance for coarse particles. • Dust concentrations in the limestone quarry were half of that measured in quarries processing granitic rock material. • Using the same setup, it was shown that crushing generates more dust and more coarse particles than drilling.

Rock from the quarry face is fed into the top of the crusher and crushed rock falls out of the bottom of the jaws. The size of the crushed stone which passes through the jaws is partly governed by the gap set at the bottom of the jaws, though larger size rocks can pass through if the rock being crushed is slabby or elongate in shape.
