If there is one crop that South Africa has managed to lift its production in the recent past it is - soybeans. Its production has grown significantly since the dawn of democracy, from 67 700 tonnes in the 1993/94 production season to 1.6 million tonnes in 2017/18. This was stimulated by the growing demand for soybean oilcake, or meal, by the animal feed industry.
