## Plant Growth and Development - GeeksforGeeks
Jul 4, 2022Plant Growth is for the most part Indeterminate - Plants have the capacity of development all through their life. This is because of the presence of meristems at specific areas in their body, and these meristems can gap and self - propagate. Development is Measurable - At a cell level, Growth is the result of an expansion in cellular

## Outdoor Growing: How To Grow Big Plants In Your Backyard
Starting your plants indoors before moving outdoors. One way to get a head start on the growing season is starting seeds or clones inside. You can grab a germination kit and get your plants hardened off. This will lead to better results, because you can essentially start your plants a few weeks before everyone else.
