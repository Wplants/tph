Lime is a mineral made by heating limestone or dolomite in a kiln. Lime is used in a variety of chemical industries, in sugar processing plants, in steel mills, sewage treatment plants, and at paper mills. "Burned" or kilned limestone was also used as plaster and mortar in the homes of early settlers, and even into the mid-20th century.
