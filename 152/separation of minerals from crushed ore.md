## Ore Sorting vs. Dense Medium Separation In Mineral Processing
Benefits Of Ore Sorting. Ore sorting can exploit a number of differences to sort particles including colour, density, hardness, radiation, and even electromagnetic properties. This means a wide range of mineral types can be separated using an ore sorting machine. Dense medium separation relies solely on particle density for sorting material

separates the heavy mineral from the fine ore. For the most finely crushed ore, processing workers use a method called froth flotation. This method is chiefly used with galena because the mineral is finely dispersed through the rock containing it. Flotation is the usual mineral separation or concentration process of choice.

## Minerals | Special Issue : Mineral Liberation - MDPI
The extent of mineral liberation is a determining parameter to define the optimal comminution process in order to obtain the maximum grade during the separation process with the lowest energy consumption. In addition, knowing what minerals accompany the ore is necessary for applying separation techniques.
