## What Is A Rolling Mill? | Metal Processing Machinery - American Steel
What Is A Rolling Mill? In metalworking, rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness and to make the thickness uniform. The concept is similar to the rolling of dough. Rolling is classified according to the temperature of the metal rolled.

## Understanding Rolling Process in Long Product Rolling Mill
If the mill rolls 800,000 tons per year, it runs at an average production rate of 114.16 tons/hour. If the utilization can be improved by 1 %, the available rolling hours is 365 x 24 x 0.81 = 7096.6, creating 87.6 extra rolling hours. At 114.16 tons/hour that is an additional 10,000 tons can be rolled.

What is the rolling mill process? In metalworking, rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness and to make the thickness uniform.  Most steel mills have rolling mill divisions that convert the semi-finished casting products into finished products.

Rolling Process Definition. The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.
