## Several Methods to Improve the Grinding Efficiency of Ball Mill
In order to achieve the required grinding fineness, the workload of the ball mill is bound to increase, so energy consumption and power consumption will also increase. In order to reduce the size of the grinding feed, it is required that the particle size of the pulverized product should be small, that is, "more pulverize and less grind".

## improve energy consumption in the ball mill
Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills  The change in power consumption between the best and worst lifter shapes is now 8.4%. ⋅ For a mill speed of 100%, the lowest specific power occurs for new lifters. Energy consumption increases as the lifters wear and is still increasing even at 22.5°, by which point it has
