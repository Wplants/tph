How it Works. Sand separation technology operates on the difference in mass between the grains of sand and the other solids present in the manure. The manure/sand mixture is transported to the separation site where water is added to reduce the viscosity of the fluid and allow the heavier sand grains to settle out of the total solutions.

## Hydrocyclones for the separation of impurities in pretreated biowaste
The calculated separation efficiency of the hydrocyclone on plant B is shown in Fig. 8. The calculated separation efficiency for impurities with a size of 0.5-1 mm, 1-2 mm, 2-4 mm and >4 mm was between 80 and more than 90%. Therefore, the calculated separation efficiency is clearly higher than in plant A.
