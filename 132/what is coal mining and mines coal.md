## What is it Like Working in a Coal Mine? - Advancing Mining
Due to the height of the mine, one has to ride virtually lying down in the mantrip with the ceiling about 8 inches above your nose. This particular mine extracts coal by using a continuous miner, which is also known as room and pillar mining. The equipment cuts a series of paths, or "rooms", leaving sections of uncut coal approximately 20

## Whats a coal mine?aroni
What does coal mining mean? A coal mine is a place where coal is dug out of the ground.. How do they mine coal? Coal miners use two primary methods to remove coal In surface mining, large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining where the tops of mountains are dynamited and removed to access coal seams.

## Coal Mining - Ohio History Central
Coal mining began in Ohio during the 1810s and 1820s. Most of Ohio's coal mines existed in eastern and southern parts of the state. Prior to the 1810s, most Ohioans heated their homes or operated their machinery with firewood. As Ohioans cleared the land to farm it, an abundance of firewood resulted, reducing the need for coal.

Definition and formation: "Kettlebottom" is a term used by miners to describe isolated rock masses in mine roofs, which tend to be semicircular when viewed from below and have a rounded or flat bottom like a kettle. Most kettlebottoms are in-place, fossil tree stumps. More precisely, they are hollowed-out trees filled with sediment.

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

The largest coal reserves are in the United States, Russia, China, Australia, and India. In the United States, coal is mined in 25 states and three major regions. In the Western Coal Region, Wyoming is the top producer—about 40% of the coal mined in the country is extracted in the state.

In underground mining, workers and machinery go down a vertical "shaft" or a slanted tunnel called a "slope" to remove the coal. Mine shafts may sink as much as 1,000 feet deep. One underground mining method is called room-and-pillar mining. With this method, much of the coal must be left behind to support the mine's roofs and walls.
