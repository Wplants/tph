## Production of Iron ore in India, 2017 - 2025 (Million Tonnes)
India's iron ore production fell in 2020 in respect to 2019, mainly due to the decline in output from the country's largest-producing state of Odisha. The delay in the auctioning of mines in Odisha - which were to be held in March 2019 - due to the lack of clarity on the maximum lease area, impacted production in the state.
