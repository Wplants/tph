## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Socio-technical study of small-scale gold mining in Suriname
1. Introduction. In Suriname, small-scale gold mining - the country's main economic sector - started in the 1990s in what is sometimes called the 'second gold rush'. The first gold rush happened hundred of years earlier, at the end of the 19th century, when new gold finds attracted miners from the Caribbean, the United States and

## The Mercury Problem in Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining
Abstract. Mercury-dependent artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice, elemental mercury is used to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand and then heated-often with a torch or over a stove-to distill the mercury and isolate the gold.
