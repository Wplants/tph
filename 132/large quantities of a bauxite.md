Bauxite, the main ore for aluminium, is another bulk material that may contain trace but significant quantities of REE. Extraction of REE, including Sc, may be possible from bauxite as it is processed, or from red mud waste. Even though the concentrations of REE are low, given the large amounts of bauxite processed, production could be significant.
