The water and carbon dioxide are removed from ores by calcination. The roasting consists of making the ores hot and very dry. It is adopted to dissipate the volatile parts, especially sulphur, by heat. Hence the roasting will not be necessary, if ore is an oxide. (3) Smelting:The melting so as to separate metal from ore is known as the smelting.

## Lithium mining: What you should know about the contentious issue
The Volkswagen Group alone plans to put some 26 million pure electric vehicles on the road by 2029. In the long term, a large proportion of the raw materials used will be recycled - this would reduce the need for "new" lithium. However, this is unlikely to make itself felt until 2030, when used batteries will be returned in large quantities.
