## Concrete recycling
Concrete recycling is the use of rubble from demolished concrete structures. Recycling is cheaper and more ecological than trucking rubble to a landfill. Crushed rubble can be used for road gravel, revetments, retaining walls, landscaping gravel, or raw material for new concrete.Large pieces can be used as bricks or slabs, or incorporated with new concrete into structures, a material called

Jun 20, 2022The strength and elastic modulus of recycled aggregate concrete are equivalent to 66% of that of natural aggregate concrete. Recycled aggregates are divided into two categories, one is recycled concrete aggregates and recycled brick aggregates, among which recycled concrete aggregates are classified into 0-5mm, 5-10mm, 10-20mm, 16-31.5mm

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) are aggregates made from clean concrete waste that must contain very little  and processed by crushing devices. Larger rocks can be reduced to smaller rocks, gravel, or even dust by these machines. Before being fed into these machines, the concrete might be filtered for rebar, wood, or other metal bits.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Once the recycled concrete has been sourced, it can be processed. This starts with crushing. RCA is first crushed using industrial equipment. This step in the process breaks up the original structure, reducing it from larger slabs into a granulated material. After the concrete is crushed, it's then run through another impactor.
