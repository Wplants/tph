Separation of sandy kaolinite suspensions in a vibration machine can be done quite reliably. The vibration method of beneficiation compared with the hydrocyclone method, which at the present time is the most promising, has a number of advantages including: it ensures high output per used area, there is no need to use high pressure pumps and the beneficiation equipment is less subject to wear

After the mined raw ore is crushed to 25.4mm by the hammer crusher, it is fed into the cage crusher to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm. The hot air in the cage crusher reduces the moisture of the kaolin from the mined 20% to 10% or so.
