Surface mining is the predominant exploitation method worldwide. In the USA, surface mining contributes about 85% of all minerals exploitation (excluding petroleum and natural gas). Almost all metallic ore (98%) and non-metallic ore (97%), and 61% of the coal is mined using surface methods in the USA (Hartman and Mutmansky, 2002).

Iron extraction from its ores takes place under special physical, mechanical and chemical processes. In the initial stage, the ore must be condensed in several stages of operation, including: crushing, grinding, sifting, washing, using a magnetic separator, or by flotation. Concentrated solution usually contains 60 to 65 percent iron, 8 to 12

## Surface mining
Strip mining is the practice of mining a seam of mineral, by first removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden); this activity is also referred to as overburden removal.It is most commonly used to mine coal and lignite (brown coal).Strip mining is only practical when the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface and/or is mostly horizontal.

## Global Iron Ore Market Trends - Mining Technology
The performance of major iron ore producers and mining projects around the world is also monitored. Global iron ore production is recovering after a 3% decline in output to 2.19 billion tonnes (Bt) in 2020. Iron ore production is expected to rise steadily to reach 2.7Bt by 2025, according to GlobalData's estimates. In partnership with

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.
