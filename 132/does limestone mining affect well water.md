## What Can Limestone Deposits Tell Scientists About The Environment In 
How did limestone originate? Limestone is formed in two ways. It can be formed with the help of living organisms and by evaporation. Ocean-dwelling organisms such as oysters clams mussels and coral use calcium carbonate (CaCO3) found in seawater to create their shells and bones. . The water pressure compacts the sediment creating limestone.

## Does Limestone Dissolve In Water? (ANSWERED) - Yes Dirt
No, limestone does not dissolve in water alone. However, limestone will dissolve in water when carbon dioxide is added. When it rains and water enters streams, lakes, and rivers where limestone is present, this acid rain contains carbon dioxide and, over time, will dissolve the limestone. Limestone is made of calcium carbonate and when

Explanation: Basically, mining tends to be a localized disturbance in the immediate area of the mine site. It does not change the global or regional land surface as much as say, deforestation in Brazil or Indonesia.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

## Is Limescale Harmful in Drinking Water? | George Brazil® Plumbing 
No. In fact, if your drinking water has a considerable amount of limescale, it's considered " hard water " and hard water is actually healthy since it contains a high amount of minerals that we need in our daily diet. But while it isn't "harmful" to drink, tap water with a high amount of limestone and other minerals can be annoying

Mine dewatering is the process of eradicating underground water from mines. When a mine extends beneath the water table, underground water is sure to permeate the mine due to gravity.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## Does temperature affect limestone? - Profound-Answers
How does limestone affect the environment? In humid climates, limestone dissolves quickly and is carried away by water. Underground mining of limestone can cause a cascading environmental impact. Mining in the karst can lower the water table, which removes the support of rock that overlies water-filled caverns, which can create sinkholes.
