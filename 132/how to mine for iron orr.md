## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
First we explore the geology of the region to find the best iron ore prospects for our mining operations. Once the ideal site has been chosen the ore is drilled and blasted. How do we mine iron ore? The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.

## How Do You Mine Iron - Realonomics
How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
