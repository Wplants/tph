## Guide to Construction Waste Disposal | GoCodes
The construction process produced less than five tonnes of waste, which is a great success if you consider that building an average house results in around 13 tonnes of waste. Also, the site achieved high overall recycling rates of 96.83%, and best of all, 100% of excavation waste was recycled.
