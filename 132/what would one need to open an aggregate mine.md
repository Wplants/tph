"Glassphalt," "Plasphalt," and used tires could replace or supplement aggregate, crushed rock, base course, sand, and gravel in highway construction. Likewise, use of re-cycled materials could be encouraged in the construction industry. This would reduce the need to open new mines and help with the problem of overloaded landfills.

The State's aggregate mine regulatory program was enacted more than 40 years ago. To date, only one aggregate mine in Illinois has failed to comply with its reclamation plan, thereby triggering bond forfeiture.

A geologist would have a substantial role in this case.
