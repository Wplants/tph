## Washing Machine Making Grinding Noise During Agitation
Step 1. Unplug the washing machine from the electrical supply. Step 2. Unplug the front panel, plug the washer back in and give it a run (without touching the appliance with your hands to avoid an electric shock). Step 3. Verify if there's any agitation noise without the pump.

## Is Your Garbage Disposal Making a Grinding Noise? | iFiX, LLC
If the disposal makes a grinding or loud noise, there is most likely an obstruction that is preventing the blades from rotating smoothly. This is usually caused by utensils or other food objects. Turn off the disposal immediately to prevent damage to the disposal. The obstruction must be removed in order for the disposal to function properly.

## Reducing noise from a grinder - Electrical Engineering general 
Reducing noise from a grinder. We are a plastic sheet extruder and we grind our scrap in a 40HP plastic grinder which grinds the sheets/thermoformed skeletons to small pieces. The grinder is old and generates a lot of noise. More than 110db while grinding. We did build a sound enclosure around it to reduce the noise but did not do much difference.
