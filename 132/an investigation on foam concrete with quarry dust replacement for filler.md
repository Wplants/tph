##  Use of Quarry Dust to Replace Sand in Concrete - IJSRP
III. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION A. Mix proportioning Two grades of concrete M20 and M25 having nominal mix proportion of 1:1.5:3 and 1:1:2 respectively were used by weight and w/c ratio was fixed according to the slump requirement of 60mm. For this concrete mix, quarry dust was added for replacement of sand from 0% to 100% in step of 10%.

Answer (1 of 4): I'm not an authority on this subject, but here are some thoughts. That depends upon what the quarry dust is. If it has minerals that will react with the cement you could get a faster or slower set time. Also, since quarry dust is quite fine, you should have a denser concrete. Hig

##  Experimental Investigation on Quarry Dust Concrete with Chemical 
Quarry dust is fine rock particles. When boulders are broken into small pieces quarry dust is formed. It is grey in colour and it is like fine aggregate. The physical and chemical properties of quarry rock dust and the fine aggregate are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. Table-1. Physical properties of quarry rock dust and natural
