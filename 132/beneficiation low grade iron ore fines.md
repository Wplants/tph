ABSTRACT The current beneficiation study examines the potential for separating ultrafine low-grade iron ore materials using a circulating-type air classifier. Statistical analysis using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was implemented for optimization of the separator critical processing parameters to achieve sharp separation at a cut size as fine as 20-38 µm.

1. Iron ore - supply and demand outline 1.1 Types of iron ore Iron ores can be classified in different ways. The most important has to do with the iron content. In many cases, ore with a total iron content of 60% to 63%, or greater, is regarded as high grade, and ore with a lower iron content is regarded as low grade.

## iron ore beneficiation process design case study
At many operating mines, ore processing facilities (OPF) have been constructed to enable beneficiation of low-grade iron ores, including ores which have been contaminated with shale, to be mined and, after upgrading, sold as high-grade products. The operation of the OPFs has also increased the iron ore resources available at these mines.
