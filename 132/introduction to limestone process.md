After the limestone rocks are processed, they are transported to a lime kiln for calcination. This is the process where the limestone is heated to a temperature above 1,472ºF for decarbonation,, removal of carbon dioxide in gaseous form, to produce quicklime. Almost half of the limestone's weight is lost as carbon dioxide. The kiln

The carbonation process dissolves calcite and releases calcium. CaCO3 + H2CO3 = Ca2+ + 2HCO3-The calcium is removed by water carrying it away (leaching). The process is accelerated, since the temperature of the area is high and water is plentiful. The quartz, if present in the limestone, will not break down because of its resistance to weathering.
