## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Gypsum which controls the settling of cement. The calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are dried, mixed and heated to a high temperature (around 1000 0 C) in a furnace. The produced granular form is called clinker. Then it is ground with 4% gypsum to obtain Portland cement. There are two main processes in manufacturing Portland cement.

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## Detailed manufacturing process of portland cement - quantity-takeoff
The mixing process for cement manufacturing is executed in 2 ways :-. • Dry process. • Wet process. a) Dry Process: Initially, both the calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are crushed in the gyratory crushers to have pieces with 2-5cm size individually. Then, the crushed materials are grinded to obtain fine particles into ball or tube

## Portland pozzolana cement (PPC): manufacturing and properties - Civil Sir
Portland Pozzolana Cement or ppc cement is manufactured by grinding the OPC clinker with 10 to 25 percent of the pozzolanic material mix with water. As per the recent time in standards of manufacturing, it is about 35% of pozzolanic material. Manufacturing process of Portland Pozzolana Cement (ppc)
