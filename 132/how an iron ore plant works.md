## Sherwin Williams Iron Ore SW 7069 ULTIMATE Paint Color Review!
SW Iron Ore vs BM Wrought Iron. Benjamin Moore Wrought Iron is often included in "best black paint" lists, though it's truly a dark gray or charcoal. It is incredibly close to Iron Ore on the Light Reflectance scale.At 6.16 LRV, it's barely lighter than Iron Ore's LRV of 6. It's very difficult to distinguish them from each other with the naked eye, even when placed side by side.
