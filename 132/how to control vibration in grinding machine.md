Sep 10, 2020Usually this is accomplished by increasing the wheel's depth of cut to a level that is heavy compared to standard cutting conditions, but still avoids these ill effects. "Meanwhile, the feed rate (or work speed) controls the wavelength of the vibration marks in the part. A slower speed shortens the wavelength.
