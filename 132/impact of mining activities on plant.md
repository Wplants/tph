## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

Environmental and social impacts of mining. Mining is a short-term activity with long-term effects. There can be no doubt that when it takes place in forest zones, it is a factor of degradation. It is calculated that, together with oil prospecting, mining is threatening 38% of the last stretches of the world's primary forests.

## How Does Mining Impact the Environment? | LoveToKnow
How Mining Methods Affect the Environment. There are many forms of mining depending on the resource being extracted. Each of these methods create types of pollution. Underground mining involves digging and tunneling to reach deep deposits like coal. Surface or strip mining removes surface vegetation and soil to exploit shallow deposits of coal.

Mining remains an essential and growing part of the modern industry. By some estimates, it makes up nearly 45% of the total global economy, and mineral production continues to increase as demand for raw materials grows around the world.. However, many mining techniques still in use can have serious impacts on both the mining site itself and the surrounding environment.

## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.

## Impact of Small-Scale Mining Activities on Physicochemical Properties 
The study assessed the impacts of small-scale mining activities on concentration and distribution of soil physicochemical properties and heavy metals. The soil samples were collected from 120 (50 m × 50 m) plots.  health risk as higher amounts of Cd in soils could result in relatively higher amounts of Cd in edible leaves of crop plants [42

## Environmental effects of mining
Air pollutants have a negative impact on plant growth, primarily through interfering with resource accumulation. Once leaves are in close contact with the atmosphere, many air pollutants, such as O3 and NOx, affect the metabolic function of the leaves and interfere with net carbon fixation by the plant canopy.  Mining activities, including
