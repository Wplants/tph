supplier of iron and manganese ore. The global manufacture of 780 million tons of raw steel in 1999, for example, required the mining of 992 million tonnes of iron ore and approximately 18 million tonnes of manganese ore. This production is from a nonrenewable reserve base. The size of this reserve base is certainly finite, but estimates

Sep 7, 2022The mining of manganese ore was a very important economic activity in Arkansas between 1849 and 1959. The region around Batesville (Independence County)—including about 100 square miles located in northwestern Independence County, southeastern Izard County, and northeastern Stone County—has produced more than ninety-eight percent of the manganese ore shipped from Arkansas.
