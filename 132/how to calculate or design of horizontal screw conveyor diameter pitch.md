Most screw conveyors manufactured today range in size from 4 to 24 inches diameter. The maximum allowable load of bulk material in a convey is 45% of the screw diameter. A 12 inch diameter screw conveyor filled to 45% can move 1,000 cubic feet of material per hour. Screw conveyors should not be filled above 45%.

## Designing Inclined Screw Conveyors for Industrial Applications
CEMA has developed standard pitches for screw conveyors: full pitch, short (2/3) pitch, and half (1/2) pitch. Full pitch screws are typically used in horizontal screw conveyors because there is no loss in conveying efficiency. As a screw conveyor is inclined, a full pitch screw will lose efficiency due to the angle of the flight. Pitch Efficiency

9.15.1 Screw Conveyors. Screw conveyors are used to convey bulk material from almost any position (vertical, horizontal, or at an incline) and are one of the most reliable methods of conveyance. The screw conveyor is composed of a pipe with a welded steel strip that is formed into a continuous helix. The helix is referred to as the flighting.

Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

## Screw Conveyor Sizing : Things to Know - EnSight Solutions
The capacity of a screw conveyor is measured in cubic feet per hour. When calculating screw conveyor sizing, manufacturers look at the desired flow rate, the diameter of the screw (the part where the blades extend), the outside diameter of the center pipe, the pitch of the screw (the distance between each blade on the screw), and the trough
