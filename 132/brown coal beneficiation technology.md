Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.
