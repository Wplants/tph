## Nickel Laterites: The World's Largest Source of Nickel
The clay zone is rich in calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron and aluminum also known as smectites which can contain trace amounts of nickel. The nickel in the limonite zone is found within the iron oxides such as goethite and hematite. The saprolite and limonite zones tend to contain the higher grades of Ni and can range from 1.5-3% and 1.2-1.7%

## Composition and origin of the ÃaldaÄ oxide nickel laterite, W. Turkey 
Nickel laterites are formed by the intense weathering of ultramafic rocks exposed in tropical to sub-tropical climates. They account for ~40% of annual global nickel production and contain ~60% of the world's total land-based nickel resources (Kuck 2008).During the weathering process, nickel-bearing minerals, olivine and serpentine, are destroyed in an oxidizing environment producing iron

Score: 4.1/5 (31 votes) . Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content.  Historically, laterite was cut into brick-like shapes and used in monument-building.

## Laterite - Mines N Minerals
The iron oxides goethite and hematite cause the red-brown color of laterites. Laterites can be soft and friable as well as firm and physically resistant. Laterite covers usually have a thickness of a few meters, but occasionally they can be much thicker. Their formation is favored by a slight relief that prevents erosion of the surface cover.
