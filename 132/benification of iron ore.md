## Whats the meaning of beneficiation?
What is the meaning of the word beneficiation?: the treatment of raw material (such as iron ore) to improve physical or chemical properties especially in preparation for smelting. What is beneficiation in mineral processing? Mineral beneficiation is a process by which valuable constituents of an ore are concentrated by means of a physical separation process.

The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

The iron ore samples were first finely ground by using a wet ball mill in the presence of sodium silicate of 0.9 kg/ton for the EA iron ore and 1.0 kg/ton for the TK iron ore, respectively. Not only particle size reduction, but also slurry dispersion were achieved in this step. The size distributions of the products are shown in Fig. 8.5.
