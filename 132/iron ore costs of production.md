## Iron and Steel - Analysis - IEA
Demand for steel, which drives steel production, is a key determinant of energy demand and steel subsector CO2 emissions. Global crude steel production increased by an average of 3% per year, including a period of relatively flat demand from . In 2020, steel production fell by 0.9%, a relatively small decline considering the scale of

China's domestic iron ore prices followed suit, touching a five-year high of Yuan 960/mt ($136/mt) in early August. Mining sources said production costs for most Chinese iron ore producers were around $90/mt on a 62% Fe basis. The most efficient miners can produce at $60/mt, but many typically only lift rates when prices rise above $100/mt CFR.
