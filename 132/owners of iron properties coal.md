## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

It is obtained from a smelting furnace in the form of oblong blocks and has a very high carbon content of 3.5 - 4.5 as it contains 90% of iron. It is produced by smelting iron ore with high-carbon fuel and reductant such as, coke usually with limestone which serves flux.

A naturally occurring, combustible sedimentary rock, coal is considered one of the world's most important energy resources. The essential ingredient in coal is carbon, squeezed from the remains of land-based plants that were buried and cooked millions of years ago. Also present in varying percentages is other matter such as hydrogen, ash, nitrogen, sulfur, and water.

Iron does not possess a singular form of crystalline structure, but shows three different forms or 'allotropes'.

## Coal Property - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal Property. Rheological Coal Properties—The crucible swelling number (CSN) is the coking property of coal and is the crucial parameter in deciding the right blend to produce the desired coke quality.  Faster coking rates and the resultant in situ crushing is an advantage to the iron makers who crush coke to produce a close sized burden

## Coal | Geoscience Australia
Properties. Coal is a combustible rock mainly composed of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements, mostly hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen.  deposits of bituminous coal were used by the Romans for the smelting of iron ore. In, coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners
