## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

Crushing and screening is typically the first step of iron ore beneficiation processes. In most ores, including iron ore, valuable minerals are usually intergrown with gangue minerals, so the minerals need to be separated in order to be liberated. This screening is an essential step prior to their separation into ore product and waste rock.
