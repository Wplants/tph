## Gold extraction
A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes.  Scotland, developed the MacArthur-Forrest Process for the extraction of gold ores.

5. Recovery of gold from Mongolian gold ore. At present, majority of gold has been recovered from gold and silver ores by means of cyanide process developed at the beginning of twentieth century as schematically shown in Figure 14. In this process, pulverized ores are leached using alkaline cyanide solution to extract gold as gold(I)-cyanide
