## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have Enough?
The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.
