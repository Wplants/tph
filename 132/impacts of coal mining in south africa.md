## Problems in the mining industry in South africa - ECDPM (2022)
Mining in South Africa has always been an enclave industry, albeit with substantial impact on the rest of the economy. In the main, minerals have been extracted from deep levels, subjected to some basic processing and then exported as ores without a great deal of beneficiation or fabrication.

In 2013, coal contributed R51 billion to South Africa's economy, compared with gold's R31 billion 1. Measured at current prices, coal is now king. The mineral's contribution to overall mining value added rose to 22,5% in 2013 from 17,4% in 1993. Platinum group metals (PGMs) came a close second in 2013, at 21,0%.

On July 21, 2020, the South African NGO groundWork secured a court victory shutting down the proposed 600 MW Khanyisa coal-fired power plant in the Mpumalanga province. At a time when coal and other fossil fuels generate 91 percent of energy in the nation, this win builds momentum for a cleaner energy system and speaks to the growing movement fighting climate change around the world.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.

## Environmental impacts associated with an abandoned mine  - ScienceDirect
Coal mining unfortunately tends to make a notable impact on the environment, the impacts varying in severity depending on whether the mine is working or abandoned, the mining methods used, and the geological conditions.  South Africa is currently moving away from a uniform effluent standards approach to water quality management towards

## How South African Mining Can Address Climate Change Challenges - BCG Global
Two of the four most significant minerals in South Africa's commodity footprint are at risk of reduced demand in the future: thermal coal and platinum group metals (PGM—platinum, palladium, rhodium). In terms of sales volume, thermal coal and PGMs are the largest mining sectors in South Africa, accounting for ~50% of total sales in mining

##  COAL MINING AND THE ENVIRONMENT - University of the Western Cape
The environmental impacts of coal mining in South Africa are reviewed. The primary impacts arise from mining, particularly underground mining, largely because South African coal mines are relatively shallow. Coal washing gives rises to large waste dumps, which may ignite spontaneously and cause air pollution.
