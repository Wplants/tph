## Improving Drill and Blast efficiency with Pitram - Micromine
Drill and blast involves the process of blasting rock at a depth to allow machinery to access and dig the materials to be processed and treated. It is an expensive exercise for mining companies and in recent years there has been a strong push from the industry to improve efficiencies in drill and blast through optimisation.

## Drilling and Blasting in Underground Mining - GRT Review
Apr 1, 2021As a process it is a technique which follows a sequence of (1) setting up a blast pattern (2) drilling a blast hole into the rock surface (3) packing it with explosives (4) detonating it to achieve different rock fragments. Blasthole drilling is one of the most important operations from a cost and its influence on the performance of the crusher

Drilling and blasting is one of the first operations to be carried out in a quarry to gain the material for further processing. The vital process often starts with a detailed survey of the quarry face, which will enable the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled, enabling the task to be carried out safely and efficiently.

## What You Need To Know About Drilling and Blasting
Aug 18, 2021What is drilling and blasting? This is a process followed to break rock for excavation purposes, via controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics. Drilling and blasting is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering projects. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock-cut.

The traditional method of drilling and blasting is to treat the two items as separate processes. A driller comes in to drill a hole; a blasting company puts explosives in the hole and blasts it. If you keep these two items separate, you cannot always achieve the best results. It's not "chemical crushing," as [Hissem] and I call it.
