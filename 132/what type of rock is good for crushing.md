RAP, however, is not hard rock, and the unique characteristics of RAP crushing can actually cause cone crushers to negatively impact product output. As cone crushers crush and re-crush the RAP to break it apart, the asphalt can be literally stripped from the RAP, creating white rock, which now requires the extra step and cost of recoating.

Today, primary crushing is viewed as more important within the balance of production and proper sizing needs. The size and type of the primary crusher should be coordinated with the type of stone, drilling and blasting patterns, and the size of the loading machine. Most operations will use a gyratory, jaw or impact crusher for primary crushing.

The same applies to many mobile crushing units. As the number of crushing stages is normally small with this type of plant, it is almost impossible to obtain a good product shape unless the rock is relatively soft and thus more suited for the production of cubic product. A centrifugal crusher in the final stage can help to solve the problem.

Place the crusher where it makes most sense, Dobler says. Also, consider if a portable setup is the way to go and what type of crusher matches your rock's needs. "You could be anywhere from operating costs that are two to three times higher with an impact crusher versus a cone crusher, assuming you're in low abrasion rock," he says
