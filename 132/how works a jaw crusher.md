## Installation of Jaw Crusher | Skills and Notes - JXSC Mine
Jaw crushers are widely used in mining smelting, building materials, roads, railways, water conservancy, and chemical industries. There will be a strong vibration in the work, because of the large hardness of crusher materials. Therefore, the work of the installation of a jaw crusher is very important.

## jaw crusher how works
How a jaw crusher works The working principle of jaw crushers: When working, the motor drives the belt and pulley to move the movable jaw up and down through the eccentric shaft When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate

## How Does A Jaw Crusher Work? - Groovy Ghoulies
Jaw crushers work according to the principle of pressure reduction. The crushing of the crushed material takes place in the wedge-shaped shaft between the fixed and the eccentric shaft moving crushing jaw.
