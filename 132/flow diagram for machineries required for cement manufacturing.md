## Construction
Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, [1] and comes from Latin constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction. [2] To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure.

Also note that if you have a newly poured concrete where you are planning to install, you will need to wait about 4 weeks to do this project so the concrete cures properly. Step 2: Create Drainage. To allow for drainage, dig a small trench around the concrete to a depth of about 1 foot. Next cover the entire surface of the concrete with crushed.
