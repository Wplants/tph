It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.

For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.

##  Analysis of anhydrite gypsum effects on quality of cement
Key Words: anhydrite, gypsum, clinker, cement 1.INTRODUCTION As it is well known, the workability property of cement solutions depends on reaction rate of C 3 A with water and to justify this, retarder raw materials are used. In cement industry, natural gypsum (CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O) is the most effective raw material for this purpose.

## Role of Gypsum in Cement and its Effects - The Constructor
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulphate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement, so its is generally termed as retarding agent of cement. It is mainly used for regulating the setting time of cement and is an indispensable component.
