Peeling belts allow you to sink fasteners into the belt by removing some of the top covers of the belt. As a result, the belt allows for better interaction with other parts of the conveyor without compromising its strength. If you have a top cover of at least 3/16" (4.5 mm), it is recommended that you cut the belt.
