## How to Process Gold Ores by Heap Leaching - FEWSTERN
Jul 14, 2022Heap leaching is also a common gold extraction process and is considered to be the most economical gold extraction process at present. It has obvious advantages in low-grade and ultra-low-grade gold mine projects. Heap leaching is widely used because of its simple process, easy operation, low energy consumption, low investment in equipment and infrastructure, and low cost.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

Bioreactors are able to process less gold ore at one time, but create a much faster oxidation process. This process usually utilizes higher grade ores compared to heap leaching. This type of bioleaching is characterized by a reactor tank in which relatively finely ground ore and nutrients are added, as well as bacteria containing solution to

Heap leaching is also a common gold extraction process and is considered to be the most economical gold extraction process at present. It has obvious advantages in low-grade and ultra-low-grade gold mine projects. Heap leaching is widely used because of its simple process, easy operation, low energy consumption, low investment in equipment and infrastructure, and low cost.
