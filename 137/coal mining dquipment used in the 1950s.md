## Coal mining - World Coal Association
The coal is loaded on to large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or direct to where it will be used. Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors.

There were two big engineering problems in mining coal underground: A system to drain water from the mine. A system to ventilate the mine and to provide fresh air to the miners. A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode. Andrew Roy was one

## Coal mining | Demagcranes
Coal is still one of the world's most important sources of energy. More than 40 per cent of all electricity used in the world is generated with coal. Its extraction is an important sector of the economy, its use forms the backbone of the emerging BRIC economic regions. And the transport of coal all over the world plays a central role in international trade.
