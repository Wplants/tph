## Separate Ore From Lead
Separate Ore From Lead. First of all the ore must be concentrated to separate the lead ore from the zinc ore for example. It turns out to be possible to do this with flotation. A substance is added that wets the zinc ore allowing it to sink to the bottom but does not wet the galena allowing it to be caught up in a.
