## Gypsum Overview: Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate (CaSO42H2O)
Gypsum analysis from FGD Gypsum sources (Flue gas desulfurization process) generally is approximately 18% to 21% Calcium and 14% to 16% sulfur. Both the calcium and sulfur can provide fertility to the soil and growing crops.

## Should You Use Gypsum for Soil? | The Family Handyman
Gypsum may seem like a miracle solution for soil, if what you need is a miracle. If your clay soil is high in sodium and the sodium has replaced other minerals, like magnesium or calcium, the soil will separate or disperse into fine particles that stick to your boots and tools. Luckily, gypsum makes soil less sticky.

2. Gypsum Helps Reclaim Sodic Soils. Gypsum is used in the reclamation of sodic soils (Aldrich and Schoonover 1951). Where the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of sodic soils is too high, it must be decreased for soil improvement and better crop growth. The most economical way is to add gypsum which supplies calcium.

The application of gypsum amends soil aggregation which, in return, promotes seed sprouting, root penetration, and aeration. In addition, gypsum's solubility promotes soil porosity which enhances water infiltration. Also, the application of gypsum enables fibrous root crops such as wheat and corn to root deeper and better absorb nutrients.

## Gypsum - Nature's Way Resources
Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral that is made up of calcium sulfate and water (CaSO4+2H2O) that is sometimes called hydrous calcium sulfate. It is the mineral calcium sulfate with two water molecules attached. By weight it is 79% calcium sulfate and 21% water. Gypsum has 23% calcium and 18% sulfur and its solubility is 150 times that of

##  Gypsum processing and use - Humanitarian Library
The presence of gypsum on or just below the surface of the ground is often indicated by changes in vegetation; some plants thrive on gypsum-rich (alkaline) soil whereas others are not at all tolerant of those conditions. Gypsum rock is usually white or colourless, although it may sometimes have grey, yellow, pink, or brown hues.
