Analogues of this type of furnace work only with the use of solid wood fuel. Regardless of the type of pipe - brick or metal - it must necessarily be insulated. Most of the generator gas leaves the chimney, and is not burned. Some parts of the furnace body are heated to 120 Â° C, which leads to the burning of dust.

This design guideline can assist to understand the basic design of furnace with suitable size, material and heat of combustion. A furnace is one of the most important pieces of equipment in a process plant. Furnace firing provides a large part of the heat for the process. The heat for the process comes from the combustion of fuels.

Furnaces have a long history of heating homes which dates back to the Roman period, circa 1200 B.C. They used a type of warm-air heating system known as "hypocaust." But after the fall of the Roman empire, people forgot about furnaces for about 1,000 years and used fireplaces instead.It was during the 13th century when Cisterian monks began using furnaces again to warm their monasteries.
