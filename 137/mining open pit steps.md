## Open Pit Mining - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
And in this case, we talk about open pits. These images are from the largest open pit gold mine in Australia. The Fimiston Open Pit, known as the super pit, located in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. The Pit stretches 3.8 kilometers by 1.35 kilometers wide at the surface. And it goes down to a depth of 500 meters.

## Open-Pit Dewatering: How It Works, and What Pump to Use - MWI Pumps
Open-pit dewatering pumps pull water out from the bottom of a construction excavation area. Look for high-head drainage pumps to do this quickly and efficiently. They do it best when suspended from underneath a single float or raft. There's more to it than removing the water in the pit. You've got to lower the groundwater table outside the

## An Overview of the Open Pit Mining Process
An Overview of the Open Pit Mining Process. Open-pit mining which is sometimes referred to as open cut mining, opencast mining or simply strip mining is a mining technique that extracts important minerals from a borrow or an open pit. There are two types of mining methods commonly used in large scale mineral mining; open pit mining and tunneling.

Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore. To mine metallurgical coal, which will later be turned into coke, it's usually necessary to sink vertical mine shafts to access coal which is deposited in layers or 'seams

In open pit mining, overburden is removed by drilling and blasting to expose the ore body, which is then mined by blasting and excavation using loaders and dump trucks.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
The first steps of copper processing are the same for both ores: mining and transporting. Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted

## What Is Open-Pit Mining? Definition and Environmental Impact - Treehugger
Open-pit mining is a type of surface mining used to extract coal, gold, and other minerals. It creates immense water and air pollution, disfigures landscapes, and destroys habitats.
