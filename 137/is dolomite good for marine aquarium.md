Dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2) is a natural rock used to add calcium magnesium carbonate to soil to provide calcium, magnesium and carbon to aid plant growth. It is used in aquariums as a method to increase the general hardness of the water (and to a degree KH). Many plants, aquatic species require a level of hardness in the water to build their bones

## Dolomite 101: Natural Stone that is Elegant and Durable
Dolomite is a sedimentary stone, which means it was formed on the surface of the earth, as opposed to granite, for example, which is formed in magma chambers under the earthÊ¼s surface. It can be found in abundance all over the world (as is the case in the Dolomite Alps in Italy) in sedimentary basins âwhich are warm, shallow, marine areas

## Dolomite (mineral)
Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass. In horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer and as a magnesium source. Dolomite is also used as the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to help buffer changes in the pH of the water.

## What is Alkalinity in Aquariums? - Everything You Need to Know
Alkalinity can be measured by collecting water samples and determining how much acid is needed to bring the water back to a stable pH level of 4.2. Alkalinity is measured in meq/L (milliequivalents per liter). This will give you a basic breakdown of the amount of monoprotic acid that needs to be added as a titrant.

Since Dolomite has little or no solvency in the marine aquarium, yet has excellent attachment sites for bacteria, it's an excellent substrate for undergravel systems. It should be washed well to remove any dust-like material that coats or accompanies the material, as it can be high in trace amounts of aluminum, arsenic, lead, and/or mercury.

## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is added to soils and potting mixes as a magnesium supplement to condition and restore soils; to neutralize acids in soils and streams; and to buffer the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to buffer pH changes in water. Dolomite is used as a feed supplement for livestock.

## Dolomite is safe as substrate? is this dolomite? - 3reef Aquarium Forums
Anaheim Hills, CA. Dolomite should be fine. Here in the US some use approximately 10% dolomite (products like Zeovit's Zeo-Mag and Brightwell's NeoMag) and 90% aragonite in the calcium reactors because the dolomite is virtually the same as aragonite with a higher concentration of Magnesium. Using it for substrate should be perfectly fine.
