## Pulverization of rubber granulates using the solid-state shear 
A single screw extruder was used to pulverize rubber granulates at high shear and compression without using cryogenic fluid for cooling. This process, solid-state shear extrusion (SSSE), is based on the large compressive shear deformation of rubber granulates, which results in the storage of a large amount of strain energy and the formation of cracks.
