## Aggregates | Difference Between Coarse And Fine | How to do Shape and 
With most particles going through a 3/8-inch sieve, fine aggregates typically consist of natural sand or crushed stone. All particles larger than 0.19 inches are coarse aggregates but usually vary between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels make up much of the remaining coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone.

Tests for Road Construction. When it comes to construction, the quality of the aggregate material is paramount. The aggregate will be used in a variety of applications, so it's important to get it right. That's why there are various tests that are carried out on the aggregate before it's used in a project.

Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete).

## what kind of coarse aggregate can be used on road construction
The aggregate is the base material for concrete and provides bulk (70-80% of cement concrete volume is coarse aggregate). It limits the shrinkage of cement concrete upon drying. The coarse and fine aggregate mixture is used as a base and sub-base course in road construction. The coarse aggregate mixed with bitumen is used in wearing coats of roads.
