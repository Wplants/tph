A fundamental model of an industrialscale jaw To achieve a model using physical modelling techniques, the machine of interest, a jaw crusher in this case, has to be broken down into smaller subsystems and modelled separately, for example, breakage, dynamics or pressure, as seen in Fig 1For this research, the modelling approach is similar to the approach used by Evertsson (2000) when developing

## Oil tanker sizes range from general purpose to ultra-large crude 
AFRA uses a scale that classifies tanker vessels according to deadweight tons, a measure of a ship's capacity to carry cargo. The approximate capacity of a ship in barrels is determined by using an estimated 90% of a ship's deadweight tonnage, and multiplying that by a barrel per metric ton conversion factor specific to each type of petroleum

Berthing with tugs offers greater flexibility to the ship handler. Factors to take into account when determining the number of tugs to be employed: • practice in the port for the particular size of ship and the designated berth. • under-keel clearance. • anticipated strength and direction of wind and its likely effect on berthing.

The ease with which oil can be distributed allows considerable latitude in the choice of sites for oil terminals. This has led, in the post-war period, to the development of natural deep water harbours and to the use of crude oil tankers with displacements well in excess of 100,000 tons. The berthing of such vessels has called for reconsideration and amplification of design data which were
