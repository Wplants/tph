## The case for wet processing iron ore - HAVER Australia
Depending on the ore type, quality and its degree of degradation, a washing and classifying plant can increase the iron content by two to five per cent, while reducing the silica, alumina, titanium oxide, sulfur and phosphorous content through removal of fines below 0.063 mm by washing. For example, decreasing the alumina content reduces the

## Adverse Effects of 9 Elements in Iron Ore on Its Smelting
The minerals badly effected on the iron ore smelting are usually sulfur, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, lead, arsenic, zinc, titanium and copper. Generally, they have the following bad effects on smelting: Elements that bad for iron ore smelting. 1 Sulfur (S): it is the most harmful element to iron ore smelting.
