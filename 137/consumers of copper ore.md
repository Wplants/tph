Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to â74 Î¼m size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.

It involves mining and then concentrating the ores before smelting and refining to produce a pure copper cathode. Although copper supplies are expected to rise by 4.3% this year, the current rate of production growth will likely not keep up with demand in the years to come. Overall, copper mining supply has grown less than 2% each year since 2013.
