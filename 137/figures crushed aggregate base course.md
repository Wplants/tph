Asphalt concrete base (ACB), also called asphalt treated base (ATB), is a dense-graded HMA with a larger nominal maximum aggregate size (1 inch) intended for use as a base course or binder course (see Figure 1). In addition to site paving benefits, ACB can be advantageous because it can provide: A waterproof barrier to prevent fines infiltration into the subgrade and pavement structure.

Sep 15, 2021The base course is the layer immediately beneath the surface course. The main objective of the base course is to provide additional load distribution, and this layer is usually constructed out of crushed aggregate. Then, the subbase layer comes between the base and the subgrade or the soil layer.

When doing structural foundations or base course under concrete slabs and asphalt pavement roadways, Aggregate Base is in use. It can be placed by attentive spreading then compacting. The sub-base if formed by dust and small chipped aggregate layers, typically Crushed Fines. The crushed aggregate base lays on heavy traffic or driveways areas.
