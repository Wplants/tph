## Cement, Sand and Aggregate Quantity in Concrete
Grade of Concrete Mix = M15 (Cement = 1 : Sand = 2 : Aggregate = 4) Sum of the ratio of Cement, Sand & Aggregate = 1+2+4 = 7. First we have to find the Dry Volume of Concrete by Increasing the Wet Volume by 54 percent. Dry Volume = Wet Volume x (54% of Wet Volume) = 1 x (54 x 1 / 100) = 1.54 Cubic Meter. Now we have to find the quantity of

There are two main ways to design the concrete mix. Design mix method :- In this method, materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code . In this method, cement, sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight, and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate Quantity in Concrete 
We find out the volume of concrete in wet condition 1m3 (After the consolidation of Cement + sand + water). So in dry conditions, we have to add 30 to 35% sand bulkage and add 20% for wastage.

## How To Calculate Quantities Of Materials For Concrete - DAILY CIVIL
Today we will discuss how to calculate quantities of materials for different concrete mix ratios. (Dry mix method) We will calculate quantities of materials for 1 m3 concrete (By volume). Let us assume the mix proportion is 1 : 2: 4 (Cement : Sand : Stone = a:b:c) Volume of wet concrete = 1 m3. Volume of dry concrete = 1 × 1.54 = 1.54 m3.

## How to Calculate Cement Sand and Aggregate Quantity in Concrete?
Density of Sand = 1450 - 1500 kg/ m3. Density of Aggregate = 1450 - 1550 kg/ m3. Quantity or Weight of Cement in 1 Bag = 50 KG. Volume of 1 Bag Cement in Cum = 0.03472 cubic meter. Volume of 1 Bag Cement in Cft = 1.226 cubic feet. Numbers of Cement Bags in 1 cum = 28.8 nos. How many Cft in 1 Cum = 35.31 cft.
