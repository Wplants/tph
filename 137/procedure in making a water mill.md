## Complete Maize Flour Milling Process Introduction
The complete maize flour milling process involves various maize milling machinery, mainly for maize cleaning and flour milling. Scientific and reasonable corn flour processing processes should be automated, which can not only reduce labor cost and energy consumption, but also ensure the quality of the final maize products.

## Chapter 18. Feed Milling Processes - Food and Agriculture Organization
To make dry feed particles pliable for close compression and to decrease friction and absorb mechanical heat, water is often added to the feed, either as the formula is mixed or in the conditioning chamber of the pellet mill. Water may be provided as liquid and/or vapour. If water is provided in the form of steam, two objectives are accomplished:

## How to Make Water From Hydrogen and Oxygen - ThoughtCo
In theory, it's easy to make water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Mix the two gases together, add a spark or sufficient heat to provide the activation energy to start the reaction, and presto—instant water. Merely mixing the two gases at room temperature, however, won't do anything, like hydrogen and oxygen molecules in the air don't
