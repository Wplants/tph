##  A short note on recycled concrete aggregate - World Scientific News
the bulk density of recycled aggregate is 10% lower than the natural aggregate. Water holding capacity: Because of having high porosity, the water holding or absorption capacity is greater in recycled aggregate rather than natural aggregate. In recycled concrete aggregate, their presents two types of an interfacial transition zone.

The produced coarse recycled concrete aggregate is sent to a rotary kiln for calcination, which can burn the combustible impurities into ashes. The calcined aggregate is then ground into powder by ball mills and Raymond mills. The calcination treatment method removes the combustibles in the recycled concrete aggregate and reduces the moisture

Therefore, this would reduce the carbon footprint of quarrying virgin aggregates. Different batches of concrete with ratios of 25%, 50% and 75% recycled material will replace the virgin aggregate. The maximum and minimum quantity of recycled aggregate required for an ideal concrete mix design can then be obtained.

The paste, composed of Portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to

However, using a recycled aggregate of more than 65% can impact the mix's durability significantly, reducing its physical properties tenfold. The optimum amount blended in with the concrete should be 35%. Some experiments have shown that the recycled aggregate is durable, no doubt, but not as sturdy as natural coarse aggregate.

##  Experimental Study on Recycled Concrete Aggregates
Various sizes of aggregate is treated with heating process. Finally the demolished concrete aggregate DCA is replaced by various percentage of 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 100% and test can be conducted and compared with nominal concrete.  natural aggregates with recycled concrete aggregate ranges from 11% to 33%. RCA can replace NA in the
