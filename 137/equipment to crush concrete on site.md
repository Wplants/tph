A common approach is to discharge the returned concrete at a location in the concrete plant for processing. The hardened discharged concrete can be subsequently crushed by a crusher and the coarser material can be reused as base for pavements or fill for other construction. However, it is not easy to utilize the material finer than 2 inches.
