## Coremaking: Life of a Casting | Reliance Foundry
Powdered natural rosin was traditionally used as a binder in core sands. Core-making methods. Cores are made by many of the same methods employed for sand molds.In addition, core blowers and screw feed machines are used. Core blowers force sand into the core box by compressed air at about 100 lb/in 2.They can be used for making all types of small- and medium-sized cores.
