Total cost is Rs. 900. Thus, the profit is Rs. 100 which amount to 10% of the sales. Suppose, out of total cost of Rs. 900, materials cost is Rs. 600. Now if one percent saving in materials cost can be achieved, then the resultant saving is Rs. 6 (1 percent of 600) which directly adds to the profit, thus, profit becomes Rs. 106.

Chloride helps battle dust and erosion by retaining moisture for longer periods of time. The particular property of chloride aids in the control of dust and the stabilization of unpaved road surfaces, resulting in long-lasting, smooth-riding roads. Chlorides can achieve 70-80% dust suppression for a low cost.

A construction site is a noisy place, meaning construction workers are subject to loud noise for long periods of time. In fact, 30 million construction workers are exposed to prolonged hazardous noise on a regular basis, and 14% of all construction workers have hearing difficulty because of this. Sound intensity is measured in units called decibels (dBA).
