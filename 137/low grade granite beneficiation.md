##  Beneficiation Study on Low-Grade Graphite Ore of Shounter Valley, Azad 
Summary: A low-grade graphite ore originating from Kael area, Shounter Valley, Azad Kashmir, assaying 8.90% graphite content was upgraded by froth flotation technique to produce a commercial grade graphite concentrate. Mineral phases present in the ore were identified by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique.
