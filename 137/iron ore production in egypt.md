Conclusion. Three areas for iron ore potentiality and mineralization have been identified as a result of integrated remotely sensed data and field geology as well as geochemical analyses. In Kom-Ombo, (area 1), the iron ores occur as inliers and cap rock-shaped on the isolated hills and mountains.

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
