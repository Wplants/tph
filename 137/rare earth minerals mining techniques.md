## How Rare-Earth Mining Has Devastated China's Environment
About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.

Feb 9, 2022Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical materials in electronics and clean technologies. With the diminishing of easily accessible minerals for mining, the REE recovery from waste is an alternative toward a circular economy. Present methods for REE recovery suffer from lengthy purifications, low extractability, and high wastewater streams.

## Carbonatite Rare Earth Elements Deposits | Geology for Investors
Introduction. Carbonatites are a special group of carbonate-rich igneous rocks and the world's primary source of rare earth elements (REE), niobium, zirconium, and phosphate oxide. They contain more than 50% primary carbonate minerals, less than 20% silicate minerals (pyroxene, amphibole, and olivine), and few phosphate minerals.
