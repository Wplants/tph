## Slag
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

## Experimental Study on Iron Ore Tailings and Bottom Ash as Fine  - IJERT
Hence, in this thesis the effectiveness of iron ore tailings and bottom ash as fine aggregates in concrete is taken for study. Initially replacement of fine aggregate with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% iron ore tailings was done. Then. replacement of fine aggregate with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% bottom ash was also done.

## Evaluation of the use of iron ore tailings in mortar formulation 
The iron ore tailings (RMF) was used in the production of mortars, as a partial replacement for fine aggregate. Mortar mixtures were developed with RMF contents of 0%, 25%, 50% and 100% replacement, by mass, of conventional fine aggregate.  The results obtained pointed out the potential of using iron ore tailings in the production of mortars
