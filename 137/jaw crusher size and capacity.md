## Fracture Toughness Based Models for the Prediction of Power Consumption 
A method for predicting the power consumption, product size, and volumetric capacity of jaw crushers based on fracture toughness has been proposed in this study. A new fracture toughness test, the Edge Notched Disk Wedge Splitting test, has been developed and verified in order to rapidly assess the fracture toughness of six quarry rocks.
