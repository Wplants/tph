## Placer mining
Placer mining / ˈ p l æ s ər / is the mining of stream bed deposits for minerals.This may be done by open-pit (also called open-cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunneling equipment.. Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones, both of which are often found in alluvial deposits—deposits of sand and gravel in

## Cyanide Process - Gold Cyanidation Process | Gold Leaching or Macarthur 
The gold is mixed with the sodium cyanide which leads to the following Elsener's equation and reaction. This is done to make soluble gold; Now the gold is soluble. This method of making soluble gold is known as leaching. In the process of leaching, a dilute form of sodium cyanide is added into the ore containing the gold.

Step-by-step explanation. Question 1. To generate income and open up new opportunities, data is the new gold. Mining data is analogous to mining for gold since both involve significant time, energy, and skill to successfully uncover useful insights inside a massive data set. Data is generally unstructured and requires sophisticated procedures

Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

The process of removing gold from its natural sources is known as mining. Historically, alluvial deposits were mined for gold manually using a process known as gold panning. As ores could be accessed below the surface utilizing strategies like pit mining, mining processes grew increasingly complex over time.

A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not.

This process does not result in gold that is 100% pure, but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.
