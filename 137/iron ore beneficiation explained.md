Iron ore, its beneficiation and agglomeration - as required for iron and steel industry: A. Iron Ore: A naturally occurring mineral from which iron (Fe) metal is extracted in various forms viz Hot metal/ DRI etc.. B. Types of Ore: Two major varieties used for iron making are Haematite Ore ( containing Ferric Oxide - Fe2O3) and Magnetite Ore (containing Ferro-Ferric Oxide - Fe3O4).

What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
