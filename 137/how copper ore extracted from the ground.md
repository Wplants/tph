## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.  The copper ore is crushed and ground to a size such that an acceptably high degree of liberation has occurred between the copper sulfide ore minerals and the gangue minerals.

## How Is Copper Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Copper Extracted? Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

How is copper extracted from copper ore? First, the ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid. This trickles slowly down through the ore, over a period of months, dissolving copper to form a weak solution of copper sulphate. The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning).
