## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

This mechano-chemical process can leach 97-99% copper directly on site, from concentrates as low as 5% copper in less than six hours. This makes it feasible for you to produce cathode copper from concentrate directly at the site rather than to sell the concentrate to a smelter. The ROL process can even leach copper from arsenic-ladden concentrates.
