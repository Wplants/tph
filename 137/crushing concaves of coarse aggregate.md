## Standard of Crushing Value of Coarse Aggregates for Permeable Asphalt 
The crushing of coarse aggregate in PA mixture is caused by the excessive contact pressure between aggregates, so the coarse aggregates are more easily crushed by vehicle load. So, the crushing value of coarse aggregate is very important for the durability of PA mixture [1-3]. Yan et al. proposed that the requirement for the crushing value

Coarse Aggregates in concrete provides body and strength to the concrete and acts as a filler material which will give the homogeneous mass of the concrete.  The crushing value of the coarse aggregate is defined as the relative measure of the resistance which is offered by the aggregate to the crushing under the gradually applied load.

What is Coarse Aggregate? The Aggregates which will get retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve and will pass through a 3-inch sieve are known as Coarse aggregate. The aggregates used in the production of concrete are inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, and recycled concrete.
