The presence of gold telluride minerals may render an ore refractory, the extent of this depends on the telluride mineral present and the mineralogical association [3]. Gold, silver, and gold/silver-telluride minerals in ores dissolve more slowly than native gold in cyanide solutions, which results in less efficient gold extraction [4].

## USB2 - Process for extracting gold from gold-bearing ore 
A process for extracting gold from a gold-bearing ore. The process includes, first, providing a leaching liquor with thiosulfate anion and ethylenediamine.
