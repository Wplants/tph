## The Use of Mercury in Gold Mining - Right for Education
Mercury is a silvery metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is used in gold mining to extract gold from rocks. A puddle of mercury is poured onto a pile of crushed rock. The mercury and the rock are then mixed. Any gold will leave the rock and stick to the mercury to form blobs. The mercury is then blowtorched and it evaporates (turns

## Gold mining causes serious mercury pollution
Currently, the amount of mercury used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining is estimated at 1,400 tons per year, more than any other use of mercury. The artisanal and small-scale gold mining industry discharges an average of about 1,000 tons of inorganic mercury each year, of which about one-third is discharged into the air, and the rest is

1. Introduction. Artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) activities have significantly expanded in the Amazon over the last two decades.

## Mercury | U.S. Geological Survey
Mercury is a rare, dense metal, slightly more common than gold in the earth's crust. Mercury occurs in several different forms, the most important of which is methylmercury. Methylmercury is the form most readily incorporated into biological tissues and most toxic to humans. Methylmercury accumulates and biomagnifies in the food chain, reaching highest concentrations in predatory fish such as

##  Mercury Use in Small-Scale Gold Mining
What Can Mining Communities Do? Cost-effective alternatives exist to reduce or eliminate mercury use in ASGM. • Use methods, such as panning or magnet sluice boxes, to obtain a preliminary concentration of gold within the ore, rather than using whole-ore amalgamation. This requires less mercury and creates less waste mercury.

The principal risks are environmental. These include acid mine drainage, cyanide spills and the failure of tailings storage dams. Mining involves a lot of earth moving - no surprise. The snag is that the same geological processes that produce valuable metals such as gold also tend to produce sulfide minerals - compounds of sulfur and minerals.

## Reducing Mercury Pollution from Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Aug 17, 2022Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

## Proposal To Determine Mercury Concentration In Gold Mining Communities
Measuring Total Mercury Due To Smallscale Gold Mining. Oct 05, 2015 The highest mercury concentration i.e. 17 ng/mg, was found in the gold mining respondents. Therefore, based on the total mercury concentration in the four indicators, the community in the gold mining area were more vulnerable to mercury than communities in non-gold mining areas.

The highest air concentration of mercury was recorded at open burning centre with 1.19-1.54 μg m -3, Table 1. Mercury levels in the ambient air were considerably higher in this Buladu site than results obtained in the active mining site in Toi gold mine, Luwuk with 0.455μg m -3 and in Slovenia which ranged from 0.01-0.49 μg m -3.
