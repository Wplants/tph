## What affects cone crusher performance? — SRP
Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so, of course, crusher performance declines. These are the two main causes of sub-optimal crushing performance, but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.
