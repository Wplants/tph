## The Outotec lithium hydroxide process - a novel direct leach process 
The Outotec Lithium Hydroxide Process concept is based on a two-stage alkaline leach process. Lithium is first extracted from the silicate mineral in a pressure leaching stage using soda ash. The reaction involves the formation of soluble lithium carbonate and mineral component analcime (NaAlSi2O6·H2O) as the main components.

## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have Enough?
Lithium obtained from salars is recovered in the form of lithium carbonate, the raw material used in lithium ion batteries. The production process is fairly straightforward and requires only natural evaporation, which leaves behind not only lithium, but also magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium.. The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million.
