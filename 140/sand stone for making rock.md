## How Are Sedimentary Rocks Formed? - WorldAtlas
Inorganic detritus rocks, conversely, are made up of non living things. These rocks, classified as 'clastic', form when other rock particles or minerals accumulate and are compacted over the duration of many years. Sandstone is the most well known example of this process, as it is rock formed from the compression of sand.

Rocks that are relatively square and rectangular are easy to fit together, which means your wall may go together faster than if you used more irregularly shaped or round rocks. You can build a stone wall with all big and blocky stones, or you can mix them with smaller stones. Beau Lark/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images.

## Which type of rock forms from sandstone that is exposed to high 
Foliated metamorphic rocks will split along cleavage lines that are parallel to the minerals that make up the rock. Slate, as an example, will split into thin sheets.  The best way to tell quartzite from sandstone is to break the rocks. Sandstone will shatter into many individual grains of sand while quartzite will break across the grains.

Sandstone is a classtic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities, making them valuable for exterior applications. Sandstone is mined by quarrying.
