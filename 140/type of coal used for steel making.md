From there, the coal is converted into coke and then used in the blast furnace-basic oxygen steelmaking process. Coal does three things in this process: it is burned to supply the huge amounts of heat required, it supplies gases to strip oxygen from the iron ore and roughly 1% of the coal ends up as carbon in the steel.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking has played a crucial role in the development of ancient, medieval, and modern technological societies. Early processes of steel making were made during the classical era in Ancient Iran, Ancient China, India, and Rome.. Cast iron is a hard, brittle material that is difficult to work, whereas steel is malleable, relatively easily formed and a versatile material.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon
