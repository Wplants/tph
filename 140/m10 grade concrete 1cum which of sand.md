## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand  - CivilNotePpt
Solution: In case of M10 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 3 : 6. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete × 1.54. Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 3 × 1.54 = 4.62 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio ÷ Sum of all ratio) × Total volume of concrete = = 0.462m 3.

Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags

There are different grades of concrete like M15, M20, M25, M60, etc. Normal grade concretes like M10, M15 & M20 are used for small-scale constructions. For large scale constructions; standard-grade & high-grade concrete like M25,M40, M45, M50, etc are used. There is a requirement for design mix in high-grade concretes.

This assumes you have the job evenly graded to the right depth, and the grade is well compacted. If you check your grade and one spot is 4", some spots are 4.5" to 5"-the best solution for both the job quality and your concrete budget is to fix the grade. Odd shapes: Transform odd shapes into rectangles and odd shapes are suddenly easy to figure.
