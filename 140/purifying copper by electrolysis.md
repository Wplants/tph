## How do we get copper from electrolysis?
Copper ions are positively charged. The negative electrode is called cathode.At the cathode, each copper ion gains two electrons. They are said to be reduced because reduction is the gain of electrons. Why is copper purified using electrolysis? Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode

## How does the electrolysis process purify copper? What are the  - Quora
Answer: The electrolytic process essentially takes fairly pure copper-blister copper-and using it as an anode, plates it out onto a pure copper cathode. The cathodes and anodes are put into a copper sulfate solution and a current run through the cell. The copper dissolves from the anode and depos

##  The Chemistry of Copper Electrolysis - Superfund
purification of ores such as copper sulfide ore. Electrolysis uses an electrical current to move ions in an electrolyte solution between two electrodes. In copper electrolysis, when a current is applied, positively-charged copper ions (called cations) leave the anode (positive electrode) and move toward the cathode (negative electrode).

## Why is copper purified by electrolysis? - ameasy
Copper is purified by the process of electrolysis.  During electrolysis anode loses as copper dissolves into the solution as copper ions. The copper ions in the solution get deposited on the pure copper strip increasing the size of cathode. The impurities which are heavy and do not get oxidised settle down as anode mud.

## How can electrolysis be used to purify copper? | Socratic
Feb 16, 2014. Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode, leaving the impurities behind. Unrefined copper is about 99 % pure. It contains traces of metals such as Fe, Zn, Ag, Au, and Pt. The purity can be increased to 99.95 % by electrolytic refining in a cell similar to that shown below.
