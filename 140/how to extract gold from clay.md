## Recovery of fine floating gold
A. The gold floats because of the surface tension of the water. In a small recirculating operation you can use a Jet Dry or dish soap to break the surface tension and the gold will not float anymore. With a dredge as long as you don't bring the gold to the surface it shouldn't float.

## Extraction of Available Boron - Biocyclopedia
The main advantage of a saturation extract is that it is easier to obtain than hot-water-soluble boron. Since the amount extracted by this method is less than that by hot-water extraction, this procedure has an advantage in determining the boron availability in toxic boron soils but would be less useful in soils containing low quantities of boron.

## Gold Recovery : 8 Steps (with Pictures) - Instructables
Step 1: Extracting Gold From Scraps. Collect any gold-containing metal scraps to which you have access, including jewelry, computer processors, old telephone wiring or gold tooth crowns. Keep in mind that outdated electronics are likelier to produce parts with a high enough level of gold to make the procedure worthwhile.
