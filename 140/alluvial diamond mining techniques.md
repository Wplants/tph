Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers. Once the water is emptied out and prevented from flowing into the area of interest, bulldozers are then used to exploit the ground of the riverbank. Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters. When the diamond-rich depth is reached, the raw

The first diamonds discovered in South Africa were from alluvial deposits. Today, industrial alluvial mining involves building a large wall to collect the water in one area. Diamonds are often found in the gravel layer, which collects under layers of other material, such as mud, clay and underwater plant-life.

## Alluvial Diamond Mining - Mineral Processing
Alluvial Deposits Diamonds Mining are recovered from ore in 5 stages:. Stage 1 - Crushing Once the diamond bearing ore and gravel is collected, it is transported to a primary crusher. The primary crusher is responsible for reducing the size of the ore into smaller, more manageable pieces or chucks measuring no larger than 150mm.
