In this method, ore is mined in horizontal slices, starting from the bottom to the top of the stope. The broken ore is left in the mined-out stope and serves as a support to the stope walls and a working platform for mining the ore above. Shrinkage stoping has a high recovery but requires steep and narrow ore bodies.

A method of short-hole mining, cut-and-fill mining is used in irregular or steeply dipping ore zones, especially where the hanging wall limits the use of long-held methods. The ore is mined either in slightly inclined or horizontal slices then it is filled with sand, waste rock, or tailings. This method is used in the construction of canals

MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.
