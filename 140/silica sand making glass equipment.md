## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

Glass is the product of melted silica sand. In order to make glass you have to heat up silica sand for several hours at 1,800 degrees Celsius or more. Lightning is able to replicate this same method in an instant because of the heat it sends off when it strikes. When lightning strikes, it lets off temperatures of 2,500 degrees Celsius, on average.
