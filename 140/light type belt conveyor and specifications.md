Slat Belt Conveyor. Slat conveyors are a type of conveying technology that uses a chain-driven loop of slats to move product from one of its ends to another. A motor drives the chain, which causes it to cycle just as belt conveyors do. Instead of a rubber belt, this conveyor type uses slats connected to a chain, providing a rigid, flat surface for every item on the conveyor.
