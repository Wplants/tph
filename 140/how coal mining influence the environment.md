## Environmental impacts of coal - Global Energy Monitor
Environmental Impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite. Pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulphuric acid and dissolved iron, and as water washes through mines, this compound forms a dilute acid, which

In mountaintop removal, the top part of a mountain is removed and the coal is taken after that. This has been commonly used in Appalachia. Surface mining is less dangerous for miners than underground mining but it does have negative effects on the environment. Because the topsoil is removed (and the plants that hold it in place) this method

## Coal Power Impacts | Union of Concerned Scientists
Coal and Air Pollution Air pollution from coal-fired power plants is linked with asthma, cancer, heart and lung ailments, neurological problems, acid rain, global warming, and other severe environmental and public health impacts. Coal impacts: air pollution When coal is burned it releases a number of airborne toxins and pollutants.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways. Additionally, coal processing has a negative effect on human health.
