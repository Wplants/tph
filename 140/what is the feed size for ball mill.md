## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical

Over the past 15 years, mine-to-mill studies have focused attention on the impact blast fragmentation has on concentrator throughput. Blasting provides the first opportunity for comminution - or size reduction. It is also a cheaper and more efficient process, compared to both crushing and grinding.

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## What Is The Feed Size For Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones. Get Price

Grinding or particle-size reduction is a major function of feed manufacturing. Many feed mills pass all incoming ingredients through a grinder for several reasons:  Within 20 seconds of entering the pellet mill, feed goes from an air-dry (about 10-12 percent moisture) condition at ambient temperature, to 15-16 percent moisture at 80-90°C

Oct 22, 2020 0183 32 For the raw materials that do not meet the feed size of the tumbling mill, they should be returned to the crusher and crushed again Material particles that are too large will not only affect the output of the tumbling mill but also damage the liner in the cylinder and reduce the service life of the ball mill

## Feed Size VS Ball Size - Grinding & Classification Circuits 
One can argue the f50 is a more realistic value since balls wear and the average ball size might be closer to half the maximum. Then the multiple would be closer to 13 times the maximum particle size fed to the ball mill. A f80 = 6 mm would need a ball size of 75 mm. An empirical model from "Emerging Trends in Mineral Processing", 2005, is
