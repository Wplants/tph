Uses of Rock. Quartzite is use for making bricks and other strong building materials. It is also growing in popularity as a decorative stone, and has a limited use as crushed stone. As it is so hard, quartzite is not quarried as much as softer stone, and tends to be taken from the surface rather than underground.
