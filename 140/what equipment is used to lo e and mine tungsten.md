Tungsten Post Office. May 26, 1944 - Oct. 12, 1962. In 1916 or 17, tungsten ore was discovered on the southeastern slope of the Eugene Mountains by Emil Stank. Two 125-ton concentrators were constructed in 1918 by competing companies, the Nevada-Humboldt Tungsten Mine Co. and the Pacific Tungsten Co., and by 1919 the camp of Tungsten formed.
