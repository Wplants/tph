Mining played an integral part in Pittsburg's history from the beginning when it began as a small coal camp and railroad stop on the way to Joplin. During its heyday, around 1915, mining accounted for over 9,000 jobs in Crawford County and produced almost 5 million tons of coal. By the 1930's coal mining has began a steady decline in the area.
