## the definition of sedimentary rock for kids
Sedimentary Rocks. Sedimentary rocks are defined as lithified sediments. Sediments are particles formed by the weathering of rocks due to forces like wind and water. However, dead organic matter Sedimentary rocks form when small grains of rock, mud and sand form layers and become compacted over a very long time. Rock breaks into small grains through the process called weathering.

Sedimentary rocks only form a small part of the Earth's crust, while they are most common to the human eye on its surface. Sedimentary rocks roughly cover 75-80% of the Earth's land area, however they only make up 5% of the Earth's crust. Limestone forms the metamorphic rock marble when subjected to extreme heat and pressure over time.

What are sedimentary rocks answer for kids? Sedimentary rocks are formed from broken down bits of other rocks or even from the remains of plants or animals. The little pieces collect in low-lying areas by lakes, oceans, and deserts. They are then compressed back into rock by the weight of the materials around them and on top of them.

## sedimentary rock | Definition, Formation, Examples, & Characteristics 
Sedimentary rocks are the lithified equivalents of sediments. They typically are produced by cementing, compacting, and otherwise solidifying preexisting unconsolidated sediments. Some varieties of sedimentary rock, however, are precipitated directly into their solid sedimentary form and exhibit no intervening existence as sediment.

A sedimentary rock is a classification of rock that forms from layers of sediments deposited and consolidated at the bottom of oceans, lakes, or other bodies of water. These rocks are formed from sediment such as minerals and other organic matter.

## Sedimentary Rocks | Mineralogy4Kids
Any rock (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) exposed at the Earth's surface can become a sedimentary rock. The forces of wind, rain, snow, and ice combine to break down or dissolve (weather), and carry away (transport) rocks exposed at the surface. These particles eventually come to rest (deposited) and become hard rock (lithified).

Sedimentary rock is one of the three different types of rock. It is defined as rock that is formed by sedimentation or composed of sediment. It is formed by processes that act on the earth's surface such as wind, rivers, waves, or glaciers, which deposit sediment over time and form sedimentary rock through a gradual process.

## Sedimentary Rocks - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)
Sedimentary rocks are formed from deposits of pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organism that accumulate on the Earth's surface. If sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock. These rocks often have distinctive layering or bedding and create many of the picturesque views of the desert southwest.
