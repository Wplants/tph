There is no agreement as to the definition of a small-scale mine. It is proposed that for a developing country a small-scale mine be defined as a producer (often sporadically) of limited amounts of minerals for deposits with a few known ore reserves, and of a character not readily amenable to mass mining. Output is won without appreciable use of mechanical energy and by exploitation of labor
