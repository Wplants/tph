After the gold ore has been removed from the earth using mining equipment, it is sent to a gold processing plant. The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process.
