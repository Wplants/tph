## Determination of Specific Gravity & Water Absorption of Aggregate 
Theory. The specific gravity of an aggregate is defined as the ratio of the mass of the solid of a given volume of sample to the mass of an equal volume of gas-free distilled water, both taken at the standard temperature i.e. 27-degree celsius. Since the aggregate generally contains voids, there are different types of specific gravities.
