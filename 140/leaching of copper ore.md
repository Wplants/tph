## Hydrometallurgy
Leaching. Leaching involves the use of aqueous solutions to extract metal from metal bearing materials which is brought into contact with a material containing a valuable metal. The first examples come from 11-12th centuries China where it was applied to extraction of copper and accounted for a significant share of total copper production. In the 17th century it was used for the same purposes

Heap Leaching. Heap leaching is an industrial mining method to dig out precious metals and copper compounds from ore. Process of heap leaching. The mined ore is crushed into tiny chunks and heaped on an impermeable plastic and/or clay lined leach pad where it may be irrigated with a leach solution to melt the valuable metals.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

## Bioleaching: Introduction, Methods, Application, Copper, Microorganisms 
Copper Leaching: To have an idea of bioleaching process copper leaching by bacteria is described as an example. Covellite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite are generally used as copper ores for bioleaching processes. Apart from containing copper, the ores also contain other elements like iron, zinc and sulphur.

Another processing option is to selectively leach the copper contained in the ores containing gold prior to the gold leaching. These processes are often associated to high reagent consumption and also to recovery issues of the leached copper. Studies have been undertaken on the application of copper/ammonia/cyanide processes for the treatment

Extraction of copper from suitable ore by leaching methods is generally assumed to cost less than the combined expense of concentration, smelting, and refining, and experimental data tend to confirm this opinion. At the Butte-Duluth plant, which is handling in excess of 100 tons of oxidized ore daily, the copper is said to cost $0.085 per pound.

## Heap Leaching of Copper Ores - State of the Science
Heap leaching accounts for around 20% of the global production of copper. In heap leaching coarsely crushed ore particles are contacted with an aqueous lixiviant percolating through large packed beds (heaps) of the ore particles, with the loaded solution collected at the foot of the heap for metal recovery, solution make-up and recycle.

## Agitated Copper Leaching & Cementation Process
In leaching plants of capacity illustrated by this flowsheet recovery of copper normally effected range from 80 to 90% of oxide copper and 70% or more of sulfide copper from average ores. PREPARATION OF THE COPPER ORE. This study is limited in general to percolation leaching as it is the most widely used method to give proper contact of solvent

## Method for recovering copper from sulfide ore materials using high 
The present invention relates generally to a process for recovering copper and other metal values from metal-containing materials through pressure leaching operations. In accordance with the various aspects of the present invention, metal-containing pregnant leach solutions from pressure leaching operations need not be significantly diluted to facilitate effective metal recovery using solvent
