## 17 Signs of Problems with Ball Mills: Quickly Remove Hidden Troubles
High temperature of the ball mill will affact the efficiency. 3 For every 1% increase in moisture, the output of the ball mill will be reduced by 8% -10%. 4 when the moisture is greater than 5%, the ball mill will be unable to perform the grinding operation. 5. The bearing of the ball mill is overheated and the motor is overloaded.

What is a ball mill? A ball mill is a size reduction or milling equipment which uses two grinding mechanisms, namely, impact and shear. 1 Unlike other size reduction equipment, such as breakers and jaw crushers, ball mills are capable of producing powders and particulate materials of mean particle sizes within the 750 to 50 micron (µm) range.. Ball mills serve both dry and wet milling
