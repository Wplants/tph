## Raw material for concrete production in the concrete batch plant
Sep 18, 2020CONCRETE is made by mixing: CEMENT, WATER, COARSE AND FINE AGGREGATES,ADMIXTURES (if required). The aim is to mix these materials in measured amounts to make concrete easy to process: TRANSPORT,PLACE,COMPACT and FINISH and which will set, and harden, to give a strong and durable product.

High content magnesia makes the cement unsound. Calcium Sulphate ( CaSO4): This ingredients is in the form og gypsum and its function is to increase the initial setting time of cement. Sulphur (S): A very small amount of sulphur is useful in making the sound of cement. If it in excess, it causes the cement to become unsound.

## How concrete is made - material, manufacture, making, how to make, used 
The first step in making concrete is to prepare the cement. One type of cement, Pordand cement, is considered superior to natural cement because it is stronger, more durable, and of a more consistent quality. To make it, the raw materials are crushed and ground into a fine powder and mixed together.

## Portland cement
Portland cement clinker is made by heating, in a cement kiln, a mixture of raw materials to a calcining temperature of above 600 °C (1,112 °F) and then a fusion temperature, which is about 1,450 °C (2,640 °F) for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker.. The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracalcium alumino ferrite.

## Materials used to produce portland cement
What are the raw materials used in the manufacture of portland cement? A. The two principal materials from which portland cement is made are a material of high lime content, such as limestone, chalk, shells, or marl, and a material of high silica and alumina content such as clay, shale, or blast-furnace slag. A small amount of iron is also needed.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of. - CivilSeek
Raw Materials of Cement. Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone, Clay, Gypsum, Fuel, and Water (in wet method). 1. Limestones: These are sedimentary, calcium carbonate rocks (CaC0 3 ). Most commonly they contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate also.

## Raw materials for cement manufacturing
Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure, its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds, which influences its color.
