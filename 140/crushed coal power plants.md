## Govt plans to supply crushed coal to power plants from Jan
Crushing reduces the overall top-size of the run-of-mine coal so that it can be more easily handled and processed within the captive power plants.

## How Fossil Fuel Was Formed And Utilized - Renewable Energy Research
Crushed coal can be mixed with oil or water (the mixture is called a slurry) and sent by pipeline to an industrial user.  One way is to clean the coal before it arrives at the power plant. This is done by simply crushing the coal into small chunks and washing it. Another way is to use "scrubbers" that remove the sulfur dioxide (a
