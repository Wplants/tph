Strip mining is a type of surface mining done in order to access buried deposits of useful minerals. In many cases, mining operations work a little like mowing the lawn: one row at a time. When this technique is used, mined strips are used to hold the removed overburden from the neighboring row, so that it does not have to be hauled off site.
