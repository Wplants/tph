## Direct Reduced Iron - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico.

The Blast Furnace is a large steel structure about 30 metres high.  The furnace gets its name from the method that is used to heat it. Pre-heated air at about 1000 o C is blasted into the furnace through nozzles near its base. The largest Blast Furnaces in the UK produce around 60 000 tonnes of iron per week.
