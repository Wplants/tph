## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## Mineral Flotation (2022)
There have been a number of important changes in the industry over the years as flotation technology and equipment have advanced. Xstrata Technology considers "the most noticeable has been the increase in sizes of the flotation machines, from the multiple small square cells that were initially used, to the 300 m³ round cells used today that are the norm in large scale plants.

## HGAL localization to cell membrane regulates B-cell receptor signaling 
HGAL distribution was determined from 3 random line profiles of a central stack of the confocal images of 12 to 15 cells. The edge of the cell was used to define the origin of the HGAL distribution and was determined by a sharp increase in the line profile. HGAL distributions were normalized to the total fluorescence from a line of 3 μm.
