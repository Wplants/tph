## History Of Limestone Mining In India
Indian Limestone Mines. Limestone with more than10 of mineral dolomite is termed dolomite limestone and that with 5 to 10 magnesium limestone The rock containing more than 95 of calcium carbonate is termed highcalcium limestone Recrystallised limestone takes good polish and is used as decorative and building stone It is then called marble.

## What is Limestone? - WorldAtlas
Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.
