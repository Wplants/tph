## Sensors Automate Grinding, Dressing Wheel Positioning
By listening for slight changes in sound, acoustic emission sensors enable grinding machine owners to automate their wheel positioning and dressing processes with precision and accuracy. The SBS SB-5500-G can accept inputs from three types of sensors. From left to right are the external bolt-on sensor, the in-spindle sensor and the fluid sensor.

## CNC machine tool monitoring by AE sensors
AE sensors are relatively easy to install in existing or new machines, and do not influence machine integrity and stiffness.
