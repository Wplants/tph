## Paramagnetic solid-state NMR assignment and novel chemical conversion 
The study of systems containing paramagnetic centers has proved useful in a variety of fields ranging from the structure elucidation of metalloproteins 15-18 to the characterization of catalytic organometallic complexes 9,19-21 and Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs). 22 In this context, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ss-NMR) is a

## The annealing kinetics of ESR signals due to paramagnetic centres in 
After γ-irradiation of modern shell, the changes in amplitude of the ESR signals at g = 2.0058, 2.0032, 2.0020 and 2.0006 (from spectra recorded at X- and Q-band) were monitored during isothermal annealing at 91 130°C. The amplitude of the g = 2.0020 signal shows a logarithmic dependence on time, suggesting that the decay may occur by the diffusion together of pairs of defects.

## Tantalum
Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, it is named after Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys..

## Paramagnetism
Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism which occurs only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials are attracted to magnetic fields, hence have a relative magnetic permeability greater than one (or, equivalently, a positive magnetic susceptibility).The force of attraction generated by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak.

## Spins at work: probing charging and discharging of organic radical 
These experiments pave the way for advanced EPR techniques for accurately determining distances between adjacent paramagnetic centers and thus for identifying performance-limiting loss mechanisms, which can eventually help develop strategies for making ORBs powerful contenders on the path towards sustainable electrochemical power sources.

## On the magnetic properties of nanodiamonds: Electronic g-tensor 
The electronic g-tensor calculations are carried out for various paramagnetic defects introduced into hydrogenated diamond nanocrystal C 35 H 36, showing that such a system can be successfully used to model magnetic properties of nanodiamonds (NDs) with paramagnetic centers containing no vacancies.In addition, it is revealed that, depending on the geometric positions in ND, paramagnetic
