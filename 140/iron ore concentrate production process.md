## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks, which increases surface area for reactions. Magnetic separation is used to remove some of the undesirable minerals or gangue in the crushed ore.
