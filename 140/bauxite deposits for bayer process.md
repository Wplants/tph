## Industrial-Process-Report - Origin of the Process Bayer
Origin of the Process Bayer Process is the process of refining alumina from bauxite by selective extraction of pure aluminum oxide dissolved in sodium hydroxide and is the most common way of producing alumina, the oxide of aluminum. It was developed by an Austrian chemist named Karl Josef Bayer.Bayer was born in Bielitz, a few kilometres southwest Cracow in Silesia, at that time a Province of

## bauxite extraction costs
The first commercial extraction of alumina Al 2 O 3 from bauxite has been attributed to Henri Sainte-Claire Deville in about 1854 Soon after this, in 1888, Karl Joseph Bayer described what is now known as the Bayer Process, which led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of aluminum metal

Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.
