## Using Lightweight Aggregate for Internal Curing
The Expanded Shale, Clay and Slate Institute (ESCSI) had experience that seemed to indicate this wasn't true so they teamed up with Peter Craig for some research. The team performed a 13-month study comparing normal weight concrete to lightweight in an unconditioned space in Dalton, Ga., with both burnished and unburnished floor finishes.

## Lightweight Concrete types and properties - Structural Guide
Share. Lightweight concrete is a mixture made with lightweight coarse aggregates. Low-weight aggregates such as shale, clay, shale, slate, volcanic pumice, ash, or perlite are used to reduce the density. Lightweight concrete is a special type of concrete made to be used for special purposes. It is not commonly used as normal-weight concrete.

## Expanded clay aggregate
Lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) or expanded clay (exclay) is a lightweight aggregate made by heating clay to around 1,200 °C (2,190 °F) in a rotary kiln.The yielding gases expand the clay by thousands of small bubbles forming during heating producing a honeycomb structure. LECA has an approximately round or potato shape due to circular movement in the kiln and is available in

15.7.2.1 Expanded Clay, Shale and Slate. Clay bricks are produced by the drying and firing of clay or shale raw material, forming a sintered porous structure. Similarly, the drying and sintering of pelletised clay or shale can produce a usable aggregate, but more especially if the raw material is capable of being 'bloated'.
