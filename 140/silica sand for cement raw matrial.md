To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

Raw materials - Understanding Cement. The most common raw rock types used in cement production are: Limestone (supplies the bulk of the lime) Clay, marl or shale (supplies the bulk of the silica, alumina and ferric oxide) Other supplementary materials such as sand, fly ash/pulverised fuel ash (PFA), or ironstone to achieve the desired bulk composition.
