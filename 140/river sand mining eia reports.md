## Sand mining is stealing the minerals from Chinese rivers
February 11, 2021. The world's largest extractive industry gets little attention. Each year up to 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel - known collectively as aggregate - are mined from rivers, lakes, oceans and hillsides. As it is the main ingredient in concrete and tarmac, our cities and roads are literally built on sand.

MINING 2.1 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and monitoring of all phases of mining In Mauritius, mining of ores is not a common activity in view of its volcanic origin. A few decades ago, lagoon sand mining was carried out by sand miners and boat owners in the shallowest parts of the largest lagoons on the north and east coast of the island.

Reviewing EIA documents can be daunting. Project proponents submit reports that include complex and obscure technical terms. Sometimes only the Executive Summary is made available to the public. The purpose of an EIA is to provide clear and impartial information about a project's potential environmental and social impacts.

The case is rather alarming in the small catchment rivers like those draining the southwestern coast of India due to limited sand resources in their alluvial reaches.

By removing too much sediment from rivers, sand mining also leads to the erosion and shrinking of river banks. Deltas can recede due to sand mining. All of these destructive effects of sand mining ultimately lead to the loss of fertile land and property. It also destabilizes the ground and causes the failure of bridges, dikes, and roads.

An assessment of the impact of sand mining on various environmental components of river ecosystems is often difficult as many of the adverse effects are surfaced only after a long period (Kondolf and others 2002).Therefore, a method that involves original investigations to document the existing environmental conditions and selected case analyses are appropriately used to attain the key
