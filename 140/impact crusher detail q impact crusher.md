## Impact crusher structure, working principle and features
1.1 Impact crushers can be divided into two types according to the number of rotors: single-rotor and double-rotor impact crushers. 1.2 The structure of the single rotor impact crusher (Figure 1) is relatively simple and consists mainly of the rotor 5 (strike plate 4), the impact plate 7 and the machine body. The rotor is fixed to the main shaft.
