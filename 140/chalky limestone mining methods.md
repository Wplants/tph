## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining. It is the easiest way to remove the limestone without causing much destruction.

## Mechanical and physical properties of chalk and impacts on mining  - ZKG
This paper focusses on the material properties of three different chalk mining operations. Although geochemically quite similar, with high CaO-contents, all three deposits have very different physical and geomechanical properties which, in turn, have impacts on slope designs as well as mining methods, mine planning and equipment selection.

If Kernite, Galena, Phosphorite, Borax, Halite, Sulfur, or a coal (lignite/brown, bituminous/black, or anthracite), then there is a decent chance of chalk or limestone being there if limonite is not detected. Consider doing more propick surveys to detect an above marker, or look for a mountain.
