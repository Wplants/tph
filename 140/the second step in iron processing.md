## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Iron- and Steel-Making Process | SpringerLink
Iron is extracted in the form of metallic iron (Fe) by reducing the oxide ores with a reducing agent. The principal agents commonly employed to serve this reduction process are the naturally occurring forms of carbon such as coke, charcoal and coal. In order to extract the iron, Fe (55-60%)-rich ore is usually used.

A typical recipe would be: Sand Mixture: silica sand (SiO2), chromite sand (FeCr2O4), or zircon sand (ZrSiO4), 75 to 85%, sometimes with a proportion of olivine, staurolite, or graphite.
