## USA - Process for the production of pig iron and sponge iron 
A process for producing pig iron is described, which contains a reducing shaft furnace 1 and a melting gasifier 2. The sponge iron produced from iron ores in the reducing shaft furnace is supplied to the melting gasifier and converted there into a pig iron melt. The gas produced in the melting gasifier is supplied directly via a line 4 as reducing gas to the reducing shaft furnace.
