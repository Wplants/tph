What Are The Negative Effects Of Sand Mining . Nov 13, 2018 Sand mining is the process of extracting sand from an open pit, sea beaches, rivers and ocean beds, river banks, deltas, or inland dunes. The extracted sand can be used for various types of manufacturing, such as concrete used in the construction of buildings and other structures.

## Magnetite iron ore mining from the ground - Simurgh
Iron extraction from its ores takes place under special physical, mechanical and chemical processes. In the initial stage, the ore must be condensed in several stages of operation, including: crushing, grinding, sifting, washing, using a magnetic separator, or by flotation. Concentrated solution usually contains 60 to 65 percent iron, 8 to 12

## Driven to Extraction: Can Sand Mining be Sustainable?
The degree to which sand mining is regulated varies hugely from place to place. Often the effect of greater regulation in one area is to displace the extraction of sand elsewhere. For example, in 2000, Chinese authorities banned sand mining in the Yangtze River after extraction had caused the collapse of bridges and riverbanks.

## What is seabed mining and why does it threaten the oceans?
Seabed mining is a method of extracting metals and minerals from the seafloor. It's used to describe both deep sea, and shallower mining techniques, although the former tends to be referred to as Deep Sea Mining (DSM). Seabed mining is similar to techniques that have been used for extracting sand to make concrete or to replenish public beaches.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
