## Asbestos Removal Process - The Safety Blog on Safety Tips for the Workplace
When doing encapsulation, the technician coats the asbestos with a sealant. During this process, the coating seals the fibers preventing them from becoming airborne. When the damage is severe, it will need to be eradicated. Hence, the building's HVAC unit is turned off, and all vents are sealed to prevent the fibers from circulating around.

Asbestos could be found all throughout chemical plants built before the U.S. government issued warnings about the hazardous material in the late 1970's. Although it is primarily known for its ability to withstand heat and fire, asbestos is also resistant to reactive chemicals . For this reason it was commonly used in laboratories.

The asbestos industry is organized in the following manner. First, asbestos ore is mined and then milled to achieve a homogeneous, graded input, which is shipped to primary industries. These primary industries then process and modify the raw asbestos fiber to produce an intermediate or finished product.

## Asbestos
Asbestos (/ æ s ˈ b ɛ s t ɒ s, æ z-,-t ə s /) is a naturally occurring fibrous silicate mineral.There are six types, all of which are composed of long and thin fibrous crystals, each fibre being composed of many microscopic "fibrils" that can be released into the atmosphere by abrasion and other processes. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various dangerous lung conditions
