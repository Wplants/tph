The sand goes through a rotating cone crusher where it falls between an upper rotating cone and a fixed lower cone. Particles that are larger between the distance of the cones are crushed while the resulting particles fall to the bottom to be collected. As you can see, sand goes through many processes before the final product is achieved.
