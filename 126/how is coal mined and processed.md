## Coal Mine Reclamation | Soil and Landscape Rehabilitation
Coal mining in the central Appalachians disturbs the natural landscape in a number of ways: First of all, there is the direct disturbance of lands that lie above the coal seams that must be reclaimed via landform and soil reconstruction followed by revegetation. Secondly, the coal that is mined usually contains large amounts of ash-forming and

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

## What is the process of collecting coal? - PostVines
Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surface—sometimes as far as 300 meters (1,000 feet). Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine, and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above ground.

Shaft mines are the deepest mines; a vertical shaft with an elevator is made from the surface down to the coal. In western Kentucky, one shaft mine reaches 1,200 feet below the surface. In room and pillar mining, the most common type of underground coal mining, coal seams are mined by a continuous miner that cuts a network of "rooms" into the seam.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Strip mining is the process of scraping the coal from the top surface of the ground.  Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air. Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
