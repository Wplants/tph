The simplest manufacturing process for producing silicon carbide is to combine silica sand and carbon in an Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace at a high temperature, between 1600°C (2910°F) and 2500°C (4530°F). Fine silicon particles can be converted to silicon carbide (SiC) by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material.

Greensand contains a mixture of 15% to 20% of clay, 6% to 8% of water and silica. Strength depends on the mixture of water and clay. The mixture acts as the bonding material in the sand. Greensand mold is that mold which is basically made from Green Sand. Greensand is soft, porous, fine and light in nature.
