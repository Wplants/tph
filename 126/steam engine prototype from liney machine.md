## Steam engine
A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder.This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work.The term "steam engine" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just

## What Is Steam Engine?- Overview, Parts and Working
A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and flywheel, into rotational force for work.

History of Steam (1800 - 1900) Richard Trevithick who had been playing with pumping engines and boilers in Cornwall for some years, built the first steam locomotive - a not very useful machine. But it was his second locomotive in 1804 that was the first really useful locomotive as it could haul loads of 25 tons at 8kph up grades of 1 in 36.

It is a single cylinder, 4" bore, single-acting uniflow steam engine. The inlet port is a solenoid valve operated by Arduino, with a sensor on the flywheel to provide timing. The materials cost is under $200. Our proof-of-concept engine design is comparable to that of the hit-and-miss gas engines from the early 1900s.
