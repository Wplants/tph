## Selected Characteristics of Limestone and Dolomite Reservoirs in The 
Abstract. Limestone reservoirs are more numerous in the United States than dolomite reservoirs (by a ratio of about 3 to 1) because limestones are more abundant than dolomite. However, in the eight states that account for over 90% of United States carbonate reservoirs, there is a statistical tendency for carbonate reservoirs to occur

## Limestone: Characteristics, Uses And Problem | GSA
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed principally of calcium carbonate (calcite) or the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite). It is commonly composed of tiny fossils, shell fragments and other fossilized debris. These fossils are frequently visible to the unaided eye on close examination of the stone surface, however this is

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

## Selected Characteristics of Limestone and Dolomite Reservoirs in  - Usgs
Limestone reservoirs are more numerous in the United States than dolomite reservoirs (by a ratio of about 3 to 1) because limestones are more abundant than dolomite. However, in the eight states that account for over 90% of United States carbonate reservoirs, there is a statistical tendency for carbonate reservoirs to occur preferentially in dolomites.

Limestone is readily available and relatively easy to cut into blocks or more elaborate carving. It is also long-lasting and stands up well to exposure. However, it is a very heavy material, making it impractical for tall buildings; it is also quite expensive. Limestone was most popular in the early 20th and late 19th centuries.
