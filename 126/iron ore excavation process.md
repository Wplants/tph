## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Manufacturing Process of Steel - Construction How
The raw materials for producing molten iron are iron ore, coking coal and fluxes (materials that help the chemical process) - mainly limestone. The hot air blast to the furnace burns the coke and maintains the very high temperatures that are needed to reduce the ore to iron. The reaction between air and the fuel generates carbon monoxide.
