## Magnesium - Essential Chemical Industry
The process involves two stages: i) production of pure magnesium chloride from sea water or brine ii) electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride (i) Production of pure magnesium chloride from sea water or brine. Where sea-water is the raw material, it is treated with dolomite which has been converted to mixed oxides by heating to a high temperature.

Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper.

## The Magnesium Production Process - EzineArticles
Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal that is never found in nature on its own. Instead, the element is found in seawater, carbon ores, dolomite, carnalite, and other minerals. Thus, the production of the metal in order to create the cutting edge magnesium sheet products begins as soon as the minerals and seawater is harvested. The following are ways that the elemental magnesium is extracted

Marine sedimentary dolomite is often interbedded with siderite and limestone layers. In lake sediments, dolomite coexists with gypsum, anhydrite, halite, and potash. Pure dolomite is a kind of mineral composed of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. The theoretical ratio of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate is roughly 1: 1.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.
