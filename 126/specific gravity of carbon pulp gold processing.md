## Carbon in pulp
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

## carbon in pulp processing gold
USARecovery of gold by a carboninpulp . A process for adsorbing gold from a leach pulp by means of activated carbon is described in which the leach pulp the leach solution together with the subdivided gold bearing ore is diluted to a specific gravity of less than that of the activated carbon and is subsequently passed upwardly through a multistage liquid/solid contacting column.

## Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table - CSGNetwork
The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that a sample of ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. As general information, kg/cu.m divided by 16.01846 = lbs/cu.ft. To help with the table, unit converters are included at the top of
