Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.

## Iron Ore,Production Process of Iron Ore,Iron Ore Beneficiation flow 
Iron Ore Introduction: Ore, which contains an economical use of iron, is called an iron ore. There are many types of iron ore, magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3), etc, which are mainly used for iron making. Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises.

## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation | ST Equipment & Technology
Iron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations, resulting in significant tailings generation. The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: mining, processing and pelletizing activities. Of these, processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.
