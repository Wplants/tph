## Cyanide Leaching Of Gold - Mine Engineer.Com
Most cyanide leaching is carried out at a alkaline pH of between 10 and 11, depending upon lab testing of individual ores and the optimum leaching/chemical use rates. The cyanide solution strength is also important in leaching gold, with the typical range of solution being in the 0.02% -0.05% NaCN. The gold particle size has a tremendous effect

## Crushed ore agglomeration and its control for heap leach operations 
Heap leaching is one of the hydrometallurgical processes that can and has served as an economical process option for the treatment of complex ores such as copper, uranium, nickel, silver and gold ores. Several heap leach operations have experienced problems associated with poor recovery due to percolation issues caused by low-grade complex ores

## Ammonia Leaching: A New Approach of Copper Industry in 
For example, the so-called Caron process was developed to recover nickel and cobalt from low-grade ores such as lateritic ores with an ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution. This process involves reductive roasting of nickel ore followed by leaching using ammonia-ammonium carbonate compound, commercially adopted in Nicaro in Cuba, Marinduque
