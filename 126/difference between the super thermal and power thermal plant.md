## Comparison of Thermal Power Plant and Nuclear Power Plant
The reduced inlet steam parameters in the nuclear plant results in lower thermal efficiencies. Nuclear plants operate at lower thermal efficiencies, lower by more than 10 %. The energy of steam per unit mass entering the turbine is also less. This results in a very high steam flow for the same MW output, almost double that of fossil power plants.

## Thermal Power Plant : Principle, Parts, Working  - mech4study
A simple steam plant works on Rankine cycle. In the first step, water is feed into a boiler at a very high pressure by BFP (boiler feed pump). This high pressurized water is heated into a boiler which converts it into high pressurized super heated steam. This high energized steam passes through steam turbine (a mechanical device which converts flow energy of fluid into mechanical energy) and
