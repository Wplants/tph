Midrex process is simple to operate and involves three major unit operations namely (i) iron ore reduction, (ii) gas preheating, and (iii) natural gas reforming. The heart of the Midrex process is its shaft furnace. It is a cylindrical, refractory-lined vessel and is a key component of the direct reduction process.

The reduction of iron oxides takes place according to the following chemical equations: (1) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (2) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e + 3 H 2 O. In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted!

Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process.
