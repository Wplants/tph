## The Facts on Cadmium | Dartmouth Toxic Metals
Cadmium is primarily found in zinc-containing ores, but it may also be found in lead and copper ores.  Until the mid-1900s, cadmium was used primarily as a leather tanning agent or as a pigment in dyes, but it was not widely used even in these applications.  People who work in industries such as metal processing, electroplating, battery

## Zinc Refining - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Cadmium occurs quite extensively in zinc ores, but in small proportions only, usually from 0.20 to 0.30 per cent.; the spelter carries somewhat varying proportions of cadmium. Only first-draw zinc carries a trifle higher proportion of cadmium than the ore, due to the high volatility of the cadmium.

## Cadmium
Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, silvery-white divalent metal. It is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. [5] Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and is used as a protective plate on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water [6] and is not flammable; however, in its
