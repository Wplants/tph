## Proposed Coal Mine in the Mon Valley Hits  - The Allegheny Front
A company that wants to build an underground coal mine in Allegheny County faces one big roadblock: the town where the mine would be built.. The Forward Township planning commission voted unanimously Wednesday to oppose a request by Australia-based Coronado Global Resources, Inc. to rezone much of its 980-acre property to create the mine. The company owns 140,000 acres of coal rights nearby.

Thus there is a considerable margin for operating costs in a fine flotation cleaning method that will materially lower the ash of the cleaned coal. Further convincing evidence that ash re­moval from coal is of major importance is found in the weekly magazine of metal working, Steel, January 29, 1951, reporting on a modern coal preparation plant.

The maintenance cost analysis for the four selected sites revealed the average costs due to corrosion for three of the plants to be approximately $2.0M/annum and about $0.7M/annum for the fourth plant. The main driver of corrosion cost is the structural steelwork used in buildings and mechanical equipment support framework.
