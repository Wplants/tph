## Refining the process that refines the coal
Abstract. First operated in 1973 to refine a sulfur-free solid fuel from coal, the Electric Power Research Institute's small pilot plant at Wilsonville, Alabama, is now a focal point for research and development in coal liquefaction. The solvent-refined coal process (SRC) is largely free of ash and so low in sulfur content that it can be burned
