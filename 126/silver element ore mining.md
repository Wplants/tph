## Visualized: The Silver Mining Journey From Ore to More
Jul 28, 2021In 2020, 784.4 million ounces of silver were mined across the world according to Metals Focus. While production is forecasted to increase by ~8% to reach 848.5 million ounces in 2021, it's still greatly outpaced by growing demand for silver. Silver demand is forecasted to see a 15% YoY increase from 2020's 896.1 million ounces to 1,033

## Silver element extraction methods - Open pit, underground mining techniques
The Silver bearing ores are mined by either open-pit or underground mining methods after which they are crushed and ground. Despite of the existence of other technologies, this metal is mined through a process that uses gravity to break and extract its ores from large deposits. This extraction method of removing the ore varies depending on the

## Silver: mineral and native element overview
Silver is a beautiful mineral and native element. It is known as one of the precious metals, and its history dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was used in many of the ways that it still is today. Sometimes, silver is mined as native silver, but most of the time, it comes from sulfide ores.

Introduction. The Cobalt-Gowganda Silver mining area (Cobalt Camp) of Ontario was one of the most prolific silver mining areas in the world. Over 600 million troy ounces of silver have been produced from mines in the area since the first vein was discovered in 1903. I am fortunate to have visited this historic area many, many times over the years.

Opening a mine and separation plant can cost from $500 million to $1 billion, depending on the location, element, ore grade, and a variety of other factors (Schuler, 2011). Below is an economic feasibility analysis for opening new mines and refineries based on the price of the element (which is driven by demand for that element).

## Silver: A native element, mineral, alloy, and byproduct - Geology
Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.
