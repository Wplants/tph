## Comparison of crushed rock sand and natural river sand as filter media 
Nov 11, 2020This material, often named artificial sand, industrial sand or crushed rock sand (CRS) has less impurities, is more environmentally friendly and cheaper compared to NRS (Mundra et al. 2016). In this paper, the performance of a rapid filter with gneissic CRS as filter bed was compared to a conventional NRS filter in pilot-scale experiments.
