At present, India's overall installed renewable capacity is 87.66 GW and of installed solar power capacity is around 35 GW. However, the push and focus on renewable do not mean India is cutting down its focus on coal. According to CIL, in the next five years, it is going to open 55 new coal mines and expand at least 193 present ones.
