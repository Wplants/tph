MINING Gold is obtained by two principal mining methods--placer and vein mining--and also as a by-product of the mining of other metals. Placer mining is used when the metal is found in unconsolidated deposits of sand and gravel from which gold can be easily separated due to its high density.  Because of its chemical stability, gold.

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

It doesn't matter if you have a 25% gold, 75% sand mixture or a 90% pure piece of sponge gold (the porous product of mercury amalgamation), you're going to use borax to melt it. Borax does not replace mercury. It is not used at the same stage of the process as mercury. Mercury is applied to a big pile of sand containing a tiny bit of gold.

A representative sample of gold mine wastes of sandy grain size was used in making the glass. Based on composition, the glass was formulated by adding an average 10.0 mass% of CaCO 3 and 5.0 mass% of Na 2 CO 3 to 35.0 mass% of SiO 2, which resulted in the production of a green-coloured glass.

Sand Mining . This black sand was very heavy and, in 1870 a number of residents started panning the sand for gold. The mining of beach sand for gold went on for 20 years between Ballina and Southport. Later analysis of the sand found that it contained titanium ores including ilmenite and rutile, with zircon and traces of tin, platinum and monazite.
