## Why Gypsum is Added to Cement? - GKToday
When cement is mixed with water, it becomes hard over a period of time. This is called setting of cement. Gypsum is often added to Portland cement to prevent early hardening or "flash setting", allowing a longer working time. Gypsum slows down the setting of cement so that cement is adequately hardened.
