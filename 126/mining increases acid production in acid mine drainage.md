## Acid Mine Drainage: Sources, Impacts and Prevention - Biotech Articles
Acid mine drainage (AMD) is acidic water having pH of less than 5, and also containing iron, sulfate and other metals which are formed under natural conditions when hardrock mines containing pyrite are exposed to the atmosphere or oxidizing environments. In other words, AMD can also be stated as outflow of the acidic water from mining sites.

## mining increases acid production in acid mine drainage
Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to be a concern in coal mining because it reduces surface water and groundwater quality (Verburg et al., 2009) and may perhaps persist for several years. In the U.S. only, AMD pollutes over 20,000 km of streams (Skousen et al., 2019). Blasting and dewatering exposes sulfide minerals, posing threats to environment.

Mine drainage forms from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting waters become rich in sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. As the iron settles out of the water, it can form red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams.

Mar 17, 2021Acid mine drainage from coal mining in the United States. Sep 01, 2020 Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to be a concern in coal mining because it reduces surface water and groundwater quality (Verburg et al., 2009) and may perhaps persist for several years. In the U.S. only, AMD pollutes over 20,000 km of streams (Skousen et al., 2019).
