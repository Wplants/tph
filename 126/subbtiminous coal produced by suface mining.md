Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

## Coal — Sources — Student Energy
Sub-bituminous coal (35%-45% carbon): Properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal. It is used primarily as fuel for electricity power generation.  Underground mining currently accounts for a larger share of world coal production than surface mining. Coal can be burned for heating or to produce electricity.

## About the Coal Industry
The majority of Canada's coal is produced by surface mining - either strip mining or open pit. Strip mining is only a temporary use of the land and reclamation can be carried out at the same time mining takes place. With open pit mining, once the pit is mined it's backfilled with earth and resurfaced with native trees, shrubs and grasses.

Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods, depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal is produced from opencut mines.

The Semirara surface mine is the largest coal producer in the Philippines accounting to about 92% of the national production. Small underground mines account for the remainder of the national domestic production. Many of the coal mines producing from semianthracite and bituminous coals are gassy and have been the cause of several mine outbursts.

## Bituminous coal
Bituminous coal, or black coal, is a type of coal containing a tar-like substance called bitumen or asphalt.Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown; often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams.It is typically hard but friable.Its quality is ranked higher than lignite and sub-bituminous coal, but lesser than anthracite.

In sub surface mining there are different important steps, one of them is ventilation. It is necessary to remove toxic fumes from exhaust or blasting. Fumes from gasoline or diesel equipment are necessary to be vented or else it is dangerous to breathe. Often ventilation shafts can be constructed so they can be used for emergency evacuation routes.

Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.
