Copper grinding process. This is the process of separating precious minerals from waste rock. At Britannia the copper ore contained just over 1% copper (though in the early years it was around 8%). The remaining 99% was mostly waste rock, called 'tailings'. In the rock, chemical and physical bonds hold the valuable minerals to the waste rock.

## Copper Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

4. Beneficiation of Copper Ore. The next step in processing is called beneficiation. This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form. 5. Smelting and Extraction. The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution. 6.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).
