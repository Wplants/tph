For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

Find the gape size when the capacity of jaw crushers is 5, the width of crusher is 3 and the closed single setting of jaw crusher is 6. This implies that; C JC = Capacity of Jaw Crushers = 5. W = Width of Crusher = 3. CSS = Closed Single Setting of Jaw Crushers = 6. G = CJC x CSS / W. G = 5 x 6 / 3. G = 30 / 3.

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.
