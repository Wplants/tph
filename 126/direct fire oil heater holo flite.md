Engineers have long believed a direct-fired heater (DFH) for deodorization is always in danger of over-heating. Commercial tests done in recent years have proved this danger can be avoided by proper furnace design. At least ten commercial deodorizers with this system are now used in Asia. A new deodorizer with a DFH was designed and built in 1986 in Taiwan. It features a single-shell design
