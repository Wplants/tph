## why is limestone used in coal power plants
Feb 14, 2012· At Lehigh, a coal-fired power plant is used to cook limestone mined from nearby to produce cement; mercury escapes into the air. In 2010, 872 pounds of mercury were emitted at Lehigh. Under new rules proposed by the Obama administration, plants will be banned from emitting more than 55 pounds of mercury per million tons of cement

, the flue exhaust gases from a coal-fired power plant are commonly led through a spray of limestone slurry in a so-called scrubber. The resultant reaction typically captures 90% or more of the SO 2. Approximately 80-85% of worldwide FGD units installed in power plants use wet limestone scrubbing vs. other technologies.
