A) Streak: Gold has a yellow streak. Pyrite has a greenish black streak. Learn how to do the streak test here. B) Hardness: Gold has a Mohs hardness of 2.5, while pyrite has a Mohs hardness of 6 to 6.5. Gold will not scratch a copper surface (Mohs hardness of 3), but pyrite will easily scratch copper.

These regions include areas where volcanic hydrothermal activity has happened in the past, near old gold mines.

## Natural Gold Indicators (Part 1) - Gold Geology Lesson 
Another thing worth noting about the quartz is that the kind of quartz that gold is generally found in is not pure white. Most commonly it will show significant iron staining, and the quartz will have a dirty appearance with reddish/brown stains. Gold can be found in pure white quartz, but it is much rarer, and highly collectable.

## Quartz and Gold Relationship: Why Are They Found Together?
Quartz and gold are often found together because they are chemically complimentary at a molecular level and because of the accommodating structure and formation of quartz. Since gold is a softer metal, it can flow through and form inside the mineral of quartz and become trapped inside as the stone develops. Within this article, we will quickly

## Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold?
Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? « Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ». The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides - also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

Fortunately, at-home testing isn't hard. You have three basic methods at your disposal: Magnetic Testing- Touch a magnet to the specimen. Pyrite is magnetic, gold isn't. Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.
