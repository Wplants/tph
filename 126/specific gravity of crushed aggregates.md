According to Brian Solomon's book Railway Maintenance, The Men and Machines That Keep the Railroads Running, today the typical layout for a well-ballasted railroad track system is stone lined to the top of the railroad ties protruding roughly 14 inches to either side. From this point the rock is tapered away on a "3-to-1" slope to an eventual distance of 9 feet,.

What Is Specific Gravity of Aggregate? Specific Gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. Water, at a temperature of 73.4°F (23°C) has a specific gravity of 1. Specific Gravity is important for several reasons. Some deleterious particles are lighter than the good aggregates.

## Determining the specific gravities of coarse aggregates utilizing 
The current method of specific gravity and absorption of coarse aggregate testing is based on the AASHTO T 85 and ASTM C-127 standards. This approach involves the soaking of the coarse aggregate samples for 15h (AASHTO T 85) and 24. ± 4 h (ASTM C-127), and drying the aggregate to its saturated-surface dry (SSD) state with the aid of a dry absorbent cloth.
