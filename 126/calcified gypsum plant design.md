Powder process technology: Gypsum is monoclinic system, with a high degree of cleavage, easily split into thin slices. When gypsum is heated to 100 ~ 200 ° C, it loses some crystal wate, and hemihydrate gypsum appears. α-hemihydrate gypsum crystal is good and solid; β-hemihydrate gypsum is flaky and cracked, with small crystal and high specific surface area than the α-hemihydrate gypsum.

## Will Gypsum Improve Clay Soil? - Garden Myths
Gypsum Improves the Structure of Clay. In sodic soil, the sodium ions disrupt the clay structure. The soil drains poorly, is sticky when wet, hard when dry, and contains very little air for plant roots. In such a situation, the calcium in gypsum knocks the sodium ions off the clay and replaces them with calcium ions.

Improper Watering. If your plants are not getting enough water, then they can end up with a calcium deficiency. The reason is that the plant absorbs calcium via water. So, if there is not enough water, then there is not enough calcium being absorbed. I would say that this soil is too dry, probably.

## Does gypsum add calcium to soilcake
For example, if you live in the coastal region, you might need to add gypsum to your soil to minimize soil salt levels. However, if you have sandy soil in your lawn, it's advisable not to apply gypsum to prevent excess calcium accumulation. Moreover, in areas where sodium levels are low, adding gypsum can deny the soil the much-needed salt.

Gypsum can be used as a source of calcium and sulfur, however, remember: Gypsum is more soluble than lime and can add calcium more rapidly to the soil. This may result in decreasing potassium or magnesium levels in the soil. Monitor this by soil testing. Michigan soils generally are calcareous-based soils meaning they are derived from materials.
