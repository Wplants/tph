## Material analysis for process control in cement plants
1 Introduction. Online measuring methods are indispensable for process control in cement factories. However, while measurements of temperatures, pressures, filling levels, flow rates, motor powers and gas analysis parameters are long established, the online measurement of material parameters for process control purposes is far less common.

Cements with high slag content, 65%, at early ages give evidence of a maximum in the course of strengths for slightly high gypsum content - about 4% - whereas at long ages there is a minimum in the course of strengths, for a gypsum content of about 5%. Above and below this value, strengths appreciably increase.
