Pitting, which results from contact fatigue, is a common failure mode in gear transmission systems and is influenced by the material strength and stress state of the contact area, which is further influenced by lubrication and roughness because of stress fluctuations. In this study, a comparative contact-fatigue test was conducted on two types of gears with different terminal machining processes.

Grinding tools, as the name implies, are machines used for grinding. Grinding is possible because of the presence of the so-called abrasive wheel. This is the main part of the grinding tool used for cutting. The role of the abrasive wheel is to make a cut on a particular surface of the material or work piece through the process known as shear deformation.
