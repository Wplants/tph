## A Proton Buffering Role for Silica in Diatoms - Science
For 40 million years, diatoms have dominated the reverse weathering of silica on Earth. These photosynthetic protists take up dissolved silicic acid from the water and precipitate opaline silica to form their cell wall. We show that the biosilica of diatoms is an effective pH buffer, enabling the enzymatic conversion of bicarbonate to CO 2, an

Visions of a reef tank covered with diatoms so thick that you can't see through the glass come to mind.

Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

## Diatoms - Rs' Science
Diatoms. Diatoms, a big group of microalgae, are free-floating unicellular algae found in both the oceans and freshwater.. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide, like glass) called a frustule.The photonic structures in the frustules such as pores and chambers on the micro to nanoscale interact with the visible

Without silica in the water they simply don't have the nutrients necessary to exist. Fortunately they are the only thing in the entire tank that requires silicates to survive. That means if you rid your tank of silicates all together, nothing will suffer except the diatoms. Where do silicates come from? Sand mostly.

Upon application of Nualgi Aquarium, the Nano Silica carries the nutrients to Diatom Algae which starts to multiply rapidly. As the diatom population grows, it consumes N and P in the tank robbing the nuisance algae. Diatoms release O2 and consume CO2 thus increasing the dissolved oxygen levels in the water which is good for fish and coral health.

Do diatoms have a two part silica shell? The two overlapping shells have intricately shaped depressions, pores, and passageways that bring the diatom's plasma membrane in contact with the environment. The fossilized remains of diatoms, also called diatomaceous earth, accumulate on the ocean floor and can be mined for use as filtering agents and abrasives.
