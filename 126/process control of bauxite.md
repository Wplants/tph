Feb 1, 2021The calcification‑carbonation method is a novel technology recovering Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3 from bauxite residue through mineral transformation, which realizes the harmless treatment of bauxite residue simultaneously. It is mainly realized by two key transformation steps such as calcification transformation and carbonation transformation of the slag phase, and multiple wet process series steps.

3.1 Introduction to Crushing and Grinding of Bauxite. The most common initial process step to feed an alumina refinery with bauxite is the crushing or sizing of the raw bauxite material that is extracted from the mine. The feed material is crushed or sized so that it is conveyable, as well as correctly dimensioned, for the next step in the process.

## Mining and Refining - Process - World Aluminium
The process stages are: 1. Milling. The bauxite is washed and crushed, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage. Lime and "spent liquor" (caustic soda returned from the precipitation stage) are added at the mills to make a pumpable slurry. 2.
