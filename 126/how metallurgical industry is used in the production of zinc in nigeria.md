Roasting is an important pyrometallurgical process. Sulphating roasting is used in the production of cobalt and zinc. Its purpose is to separate the metals so that they can be transformed into a water-soluble form for further hydrometallurgical processing. The smelting of sulphidic ores produces a partially oxidized metal concentrate (matte).

Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30. Zinc is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a silvery-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table.In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn 2+ and Mg 2+ ions

ZINC INDUSTRYZINC INDUSTRY. Zinc was first introduced commercially in the United States during the 1850s, with small-scale smelting plants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas, near sources of ore and fuel. The principal early use of zinc was in the production of brass, a zinc-copper alloy. Source for information on Zinc Industry: Dictionary of American History dictionary.

## Liquid waste treatment in galvanizing and zinc electroplating
Grain refiners can be added to help produce a uniform and well-bonded zinc coating on the steel. Electroplating is applied to steel sheets and wires, and are therefore used in applications similar to galvanizing a continuous sheet or wire. The most common applications are in the automotive industry and equipment mountings and fasteners.
