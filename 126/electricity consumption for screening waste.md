## Electric Energy Consumption - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The global consumption of electric energy by electric motors is dominated by four major motor applications. According to Refs [5,8] [5] [8], in 2006 the corresponding share was as follows: compressors 32%, mechanical movement 30%, pumps 19%, and fans 19%.It follows from these values that pumps are responsible for about 8-9% of the global consumption of electric energy.
