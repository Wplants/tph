## Mechanical Engineering Resources: Codes and Standards
A code is a set of rules and specifications for the correct methods and materials used in a certain product, building or process. Codes can be approved by local, state or federal governments and can carry the force of law. The main purpose of codes is to protect the public by setting up the minimum acceptable level of safety for buildings, products and processes.

## Offshore Wind Codes and Standards
The most complete sets of codes and standards are for bottom fixed offshore wind is by DNV and IEC. The IEC is focusing on wind turbine and electronical components and system, whilst DNV is focusing on design, engineering, manufacturing, installation and operation. The most relevant for offshore wind mooring and foundations are listed below.
