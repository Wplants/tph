## How the global steel industry is cutting out coal | The Narwhal
May 1, 2021Companies like SSAB have developed plans to eliminate coal from their steel plants. In place of coke, derived from coal, the company plans to use clean hydrogen. Like carbon, hydrogen can also strip oxygen from iron ore to make the pure iron needed in steel-making. But in this reaction, the resulting "emission" is H20. Photo: SSAB

Global coal consumption is estimated to have fallen by 7%, or over 500 million tonnes, between 2018 in 2020. A decline of this size over a two-year period is unprecedented in IEA records, which go back as far as 1971. Based on the assumption of a global economic recovery in 2021, we expect both electricity demand and industrial output to increase.

Why is coal used in making steel? - Coal in New Zealand. Along with iron ore, coal's one of the key ingredients when making steel from raw materials [2] This is because coal, once turned into coke, provides a source of carbon, which is vital for stripping oxygen from iron ore and turning it into pure iron [3] To this day this is the only way to economically produce steel from raw materials

Steelmaking coal, also referred to as metallurgical or coking coal, is, as its name suggests, an essential ingredient in the production of steel. Unlike its thermal counterpart, which is used for power generation, metallurgical coal is transformed into coke, the carbon source used to produce metals that we rely on every day.

Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap.In steelmaking, impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and excess carbon (the most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.
