## Aggregates for Concrete - GreenSpec
Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

## Replacement Of Sand By Using Crushed Concrete Debris
In present study fine aggregates (sand) in concrete are replaced partially and fully with RCA (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) and the corresponding physical and mechanical properties were studied and compared with normal concrete. The results obtained showed that the use of crushed concrete debris as fine aggregate in concrete can be replaced for
