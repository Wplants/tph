## How Gold Is Mined | Gold Mining Process | World Gold Council
The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as dor√© - typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors - such as the

Before gold is mined, we first carryout a significant exploration and development to determine the size of the gold deposit in a particular gold mine. The process or lifecycle of gold mine starts with exploration (1-10 years), development (this takes about 1 to 5 years), operation (10-30 years), decommissioning (1-5 years) and the post closure.

## Developing public health strategies for artisanal and small-scale 
Overview Mercury amalgamation remains the preferred method to extract gold employed in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) worldwide. Liquid elemental mercury is added to an ore slurry to bind to gold and form a gold-mercury complex (amalgam). When gold is separated from mercury in the smelting process, high concentrations of mercury vapours are released.

## The Common Gold Mining Process - Gravity Separation Method
In the sand gold deposits, the gold usually exists in the form of monomer natural gold, and its particle size is generally more than 16t/m 3, which has a big difference with gangue density, so gravity separation method is the most effective and economic gold mining process. However, gravity separation method is rarely used alone in the lode

## What is gold mining and how is it done differently? : stocks_03
The process of removing gold from its natural sources is known as mining. Historically, alluvial deposits were mined for gold manually using a process known as gold panning. As ores could be accessed below the surface utilizing strategies like pit mining, mining processes grew increasingly complex over time.
